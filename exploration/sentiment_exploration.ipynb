      "BODY\n",
      "PS4 players are being told the deplorable performance of their game on consoles is somehow their fault, as they are attempting to \"run a next-gen game on a 7-year-old console\". This, of course, ignoring it was CDPR who chose to design, market and release the game on that very console. The game's planning had begun *before* the PS4 even released. The game built up substantial expectation *during* its first years. If it has arrived \"too late\", it's on the CDPR project managers. A release on that console was promised when it was feasible, and was sworn to be feasible. CDPR, late into the decade, even claimed PS3 performance was \"surprisingly good\"! To think some Cyberpunk fans are doing damage control for CDPR's fraud for free is hilarious, considering it should be their PR team pulling damage control, *not you guys*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow, people keep claiming this \"next-gen of gaming\" is worth the hussle. In order to play at a stable 60FPS at 1080p, no less than a 1080 should be advised. In fact, one should think of an RTX 2060 just to be sure. However, CDPR proudly announced a GTX 1060, a 2016 GPU, would be enough to run it on \"recommended\". \"Recommended\": I am shocked to find most people seem to think the industry standard for \"recommended\" is meant to be an unstable, choppy playthrough. Let us not forget that, according to Steam, [the GTX 1060 is the most popular GPU at the moment](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam), a convenient statistic for the marketing team to make use of. The world wonders whether CDPR knew they could maximize sales by not discouraging gamers who are skeptical about their PCs' performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some have said it's the *community's fault* that this is a wreck. Overhyping, you say? CDPR has repeatedly fueled the fire in interviews, investor calls and social media. Don't you understand? Your hype was their project's commercial success. They aren't a benevolent group of gamer-loving philanthropists. You've upvoted posts to the front page of this sub, which tell people to \"delay the game yourself\" (as in, waiting) or to \"stop overhyping\" as if **each and every one of CDPR's promises** hadn't been made with pure hype and PR in mind. When you perpetuate these myths that they are some industry prodigies, you do more PR for them than their actual PR team! And when you bar the critics from calling them out with an arsenal of half-cooked excuses, you do what the underpaid intern over and Twitter is supposed to do: to defend the indefensible. You were promised a good game. Demand a good game!\n",

You know, deep down below, that the reason codes for console reviewers weren't sent out is, very likely, because it would've popped the pre-order and day one purchase bubble. If EA had done this, the world would be up in arms -- but your false prophets at Poland somehow get a pass.\n",

The issue, perhaps, is that fundamental concerns about AI behaviour or engine physics cannot be simply \"patched up\".

      "First off what triggers them? You would guess that they come after you kill enough people and then it maybe takes them like 30 seconds to roll up in cars to kill you right? No. If you kill one person, they immediately spawn in front of you out of thin air and start multiplying. The more you kill the harder it is and the game always surrounds you in cops so it’s almost impossible to survive if too many spawn. I have no words for how poorly this was designed. Oh and btw if you are aiming at civilians, cops also have the chance to spawn on you from that as well. Even if you are shooting at gang members and a civilian happens to be in your crosshairs, the cops don’t give a shit. They will go “woah buddy. You gunning down a gang? Good. AIMING AT A CIVILIAN?! THATS ILLEGAL!”\n",

All you have to do is drive down the street and you lose them anyways so what’s the point? Even running from them immediately loses them. They don’t even bother to chase you unless you are within 20 meters of them. They don’t even chase you in cars. In fact, I have never seen a single police officer driving a car. The most I’ve seen is them parked on the side of the road. I don’t even think enemies in the open world drive cars besides in the missions and that’s really sad. I don’t care if the driving enemy AI is so bad that they drive off road and crash into walls. At least have driving enemy AI in the game. Like come on. How can a game from like 2008 have driving enemy AI but an open world game in 2020 doesn’t? This is unacceptable.\n",

      "Rant (Edit:) To all the CDPR apologists in the comments defending this, no excuse you say can get around the fact that Cyberpunk2077 has some of the worst AI. “Oh but this is an RPG! You aren’t supposed to be chased by police. It doesn’t matter that there wasn’t much work out into it.” This isn’t a an RPG. CDPR removed it from marketing and started calling it an action adventure game. Lets raise a hypothetical that it was an RPG for a second. Genre doesn’t give a game a free pass for having little to no effort put into a part of a game. The thing that makes a game great is having freedom. If I want to go murder civilians, I should be able to without instantly dying to a cop that spawned behind me. If that freedom is too restricted, it becomes shallow and bland. Open world games are known for having freedom regardless of how you want to categorize it. Cyberpunk is far from full freedom. It tricks you with the fantasy of choice with the story and then releases you into a hollow world that you soon realize consists of nothing but lots of similar activities in a huge world with scripted opportunity.\n",

Only after hundreds of people allegedly confirming that it made noticable diffferences, stability being the most common, reflecting purposefully increased memory pools, I started to collect data and tried to draw a better picture since some characteristics seemed very distinct (for example new Ryzens seeming to be totally unaffected). Maybe I got hit with placebo, but how the hell is it possible thousands of people appearantly did too? This bugs me quite a bit.\n",

Obviously it's hard to argue with patchnotes most likely backed by developers or a member of QA, but for me my personal changes were far beyond any deviation that would fall in within placebo limits. (Yes, I am very aware that a game restart can fix a common memory leak issue or can get the game the chance to reorder itself, therefore giving you a few perceived temporary extra fps gains) I am still positive my game ran way more stable (even on higher settings and better resolution) and it recovered a lot better from fps drops.

This was actually subject of lengthy debates in this thread, as some of you are happy with the \"RPGness\" of CP2077. Personally I have not seen a lot of elements that make a game an RPG, such as relevant checks (speech, perception... right now all we have are options to break a door or go around it), solid companions, defined power dynamics between factions and a general sense of progression achieved through meaningful upgrade to your character. The game right now is more akin to a shooter/looter with stats. Which is not \"strong RPG element\". Mind you, if you like it this way it's perfect, and I personally don't mind it too much. But the lack of RPG components does stay in the list as a promised not fulfilled. And no, madqueen, having 7 different finales that you get to choose doesn't make a looter/shooter an RPG.\n",

The Witcher 3 was a masterpiece, so naturally I was pretty invested in whatever that was their next project. One fine day I saw a tweet from them, it was \"Beep\", I think. And I was thrilled to know that it has begun. Saw the E3 trailer and it was okay, nothing mind blowing, honestly. But then came their gameplay trailer and I, like most of the people out there, was blown away by the sheer scale of the game.

Like have you seen how phenomenally they have animated Silverhand's hand gestures? When you open the photo mode and somehow manage to zoom in one one single subject, the details, the textures, the reflections even without RTX, the chrome plates on NPCs, markings on them. Everything is so damn gorgeous, precise and well done. And don't get me started on the guns and the cars. I have played copious amount of games and I have not seen any game that has a better gun design, as well as the car design; I know that's a subjective affair but still. The car designs are so well done. Unique and original. I have this car called, Jefferson or something like that, and its front is a pure expression of how unique their designs are. It is highly asymmetrical and still very beautiful. The characters, although I have not met many, are so well crafted that you can literally take a closeup of any part of their bodies {except some(of course)} and make a wallpaper out of it. Have you seen the neck of Takemura? Those gorgeous red undertones with Arasaka stamped on it. The design itself has a certain depth to it which makes you wonder about how things ended up where they are. Other than the design, the campaign missions are so well executed and acted. I am leaving out on writing about this part because it brings out the spoilery stuff. But it is very well done. Amazing, really.\n",
