# Cyberpunk-2077_reddit_posts_analysis
We explore the reddit posts data from 2020/8/21 to 2021/2/14, find the topics of these posts and analyze the sentiments of these posts.


Backgroud:
Cyberpunk 2077 is a RPG developed by CD Projekt ([wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077)). Because of the great success of this company's last RPG: the Witcher3: Wild Hunt, Cyberpunk 2077 was highly anticipated before it release. The company has delayed game release three times, finally to 2020/12/10. But the launch was distraunous because the game suffered from numerous bugs and bad performances. Later the company suspended the distribution of this game on playstation 4 platform. An official apology and a commitment to quality was announced on 2021/01/13. And several fixes and patches were released intermittently.
