Like all of you, the mod team is very disappointed in hearing about the ~~first~~ ~~second~~ third delay of Cyberpunk 2077.

As you can see, the subreddit is currently locked in order to try and stop the sub [from being overwhelmed with spam](https://streamable.com/9spfgr). We will unlock the sub shortly after this post is made, but we are asking you to keep a few things in mind:

* For now, the subreddit will only allow text posts. This is to avoid low-effort memes and image-reaction posts.
* As well, the subreddit will move into approve-only mode. This means that a post needs to be approved before it is live on the subreddit.
* Please check the front page of the subreddit to see if someone has already posted the same take on the delay as you. It is better to comment on that post, rather than making an entire new post that shares the same opinion.
* If the subreddit quickly becomes filled with spam, we may need to lock it again. Please avoid posting low-effort reactions
* Adhere to rule 8 and do not encourage boycotting purchasing the game. Breaking this rule can and will likely result in a ban.

All said, we are still extremely excited for the launch of the game and can't wait to share the experience with the entire subreddit. Please try to stay level-headed so we can all make the subreddit the best discussion forum for all fans of Cyberpunk 2077.";0;1109;1109;1480;0;1

But what I am seeing is a lot of people trolling fans who are angry at delay with sentences like ""It's just a game"" or ""We can wait they are making it better for us"". I think that these lines are exactly what's allowing CDPR to get away with this unprofessional behaviour. I would've been okay with a Q1 2021 release date but 3 micro delays? At this point it's like CDPR is just toying with us. Am I wrong in assuming that CDPR has some accountability towards the gaming community? Am I wrong to deem them highly unprofessional?";0;98;98;261;0;0

489;jz9421;Question;All romanceable characters so far and what we need to do/have to romance them.;2020-11-22;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/jz9421/all_romanceable_characters_so_far_and_what_we/;"So I have been trying to catch up with the latest news on Cyberpunk and I have found out the following characters may be romanceable: Panam, Judy, Rivers, and Meredith.

Panam is a former nomad that V meets on their quest to obtain the Relic. Apparently you can bond with her over drinks, being loners, and blowing stuff up. All in all she sounds like a good girl to hang out with in Cyberpunk.

Judy is a member of the Moxies and a braindance editor who hates Arasaka and the Tyger Claws. All I know about her is that she meet V during the main storyline and she is very popular with a lot of fans. She is also more of an idealist than most of the other character in the game and may have her own ideas on how to use the chip to take down Arasaka.

Rivers is a a detective that is investigating the death of the mayor. I don't know much about him, but accoriding gamespot article some fans would like him to become a romance option.

Meredith is a corpo agent that works for Militech. All that we know about her is that she betrays V during the mission to retrieve a bot from Maelstrom in the demo. Hopefully, a V with a corpo background will get to know more about her.

So this is all I know about which romance options are available to us so far. Does anyone know anymore options? And if you do what qualifications must V meet to romance them? By qualifications I mean what lifepath must V have in order to romance them and what gender must V have. All that I have heard regarding this is that Judy is a lesbian, Panam likes a V with a nomad lifepath, and Meredith can only be romanced by a V with a corpo lifepath.";0;44;44;70;0;0

Maybe I'm alone here, and maybe I'm a bit harsh for saying this. But I don't care about other peoples loading screens. All the rest of us are going to see the exact same thing. 

Think we can institute a ban on these types of posts so the new page has some actual interesting stuff

# --Official Release/Preload Times--

From CDPR: [https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1334548241459933188](https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1334548241459933188)

Pretty much what we knew on PC due to the GoG counter, but sadly seems console players have local midnight release. There you go!

# --Is the game DRM Free? (ON PC, obviously)--

Yes. CDPR is vehemently against DRM, and the DRM-free nature of Cyberpunk has been confirmed by journalists. Whether it's Steam, GoG, or Epic Game Store, you will be able to run the game without any of them open, and YES, you can technically just copy and paste the game onto 20 computers if you wanted. That's just what DRM-free means, but PLEASE support the developers.

Again, this obviously doesn't include stuff like consoles or Stadia which are inherently locked by nature.

# --Difference between Steam and GoG?--

Ultimately, no differences. Both are DRM free, both have achievements, both will update at the same time. CDPR, the makers of Cyberpunk 2077, own GOG, so if you buy it from there the devs get 100% of your money. Every platform will get its own comic and on Steam you get an exclusive short story; they'll all probably be all over the internet in 5 seconds though, if you really care.

# --PC Performance or ""Can I run it?""--

[Here are the official hardware requirements](https://cdn-l-mkt.cdprojektred.com/image/16_9_EN_3-_02qt7qdkx3b50kqk.jpg), but I'll tell you now that no one really knows how it'll actually run in reality because they've given us no information about FPS targets on PC (we can probably safely assume 60, as that is the standard on PC).

[Anyway, here is the RTX ray tracing gameplay trailer for the 30xx unicorns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efo-YDWnnpw).

AMD and thus next-gen console raytracing will come eventually, but right now it's limited to Nvidia GPUs.

# --Will there be official modding support?--

CDPR has been inconsistent with official support for their games. Their official word for Cyberpunk 2077 specifically is ""not at the moment"" because they want to focus on the core game, which I guess isn't a *no*. Witcher 2 actually had RedKit for official modding support, and Cyberpunk 2077 uses an upgraded version of the same engine, so it's possible a new RedKit will be released someday.

However, even without modding support at the start, Witcher 3 still had a ton of modding. Most notably, the infamous nudity mods that gave gamers the world over the joy of seeing Geralt's buttery buttocks all the time instead of just in a few scenes, because no one cared about anyone else's buttocks, *obviously.*

With the popularity of the game, though, CDPR would be bonkers to *not* officially add modding support, and honestly, the modding community probably won't care even if they don't.

So that's kind of where we're at: A solid WE SHALL SEE.

# --Next-gen Patch? How does it run on consoles?--

Note that CDPR hasn't said a single thing about FPS/resolution targets on any of the consoles either, sorry. IMO this is really something they should revealed already, but meh.

Next-gen patch is planned for next year; CDPR has not given a date. The game runs a bit better on next-gen consoles, but will not have any next-gen features or graphical enhancements until this patch.

[Here is the official X Box One X and Series X gameplay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yQ--nrwy5w)

[Here is the official PS5 and PS4 Pro gameplay](https://youtu.be/pFB-Z6mNKvM).

Note that outside of these videos, all gameplay has been on high end PCs, so please don't let your expectations get out of hand due to the trailers. No gameplay has been shown on the base models. CDPR says it runs fine, but, again, I'd seriously taper my expectations.

**Cyberpunk 2077 will offer a fee next-gen copy** of the game for those who buy an old-gen version, so you don't have to buy the game twice. The game also features cross-saves between consoles of the same brand, detailed [here for Sony](https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/playstation/sp-technical/issue/1598/playstation-4-to-playstation-5-cross-save-backwards-compatibility) and [here for Microsoft](https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/xbox/sp-technical/issue/1601/xbox-one-to-xbox-series-x-s-cross-save-backwards-compatibility).

# --GoG Account Link Freebies?--

CDPR hasn't actually spoken about this, but they have mentioned there will be [shirts and swords and other goodies](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnM_I5RWMAMdJFE?format=jpg&name=large) if you own their prior games, and that it doesn't matter where you own them. Expect information this week, likely.

# --Multiplayer--

This will be free for anyone who already owns the base game (so half the world, I guess). There's no release date, but it was expected in 2022 and may now release in 2023 instead. We don't have many details other than it's being headed by some MMO veterans and is a separate AAA project according to CDPR.

For people asking, it's actually old news that it'll be free (sorry couldn't find the original interview), but I guess they could change their minds over the next 2 years, and the way they worded it makes it sound like you will also be able to buy it as a standalone, but we don't know for sure. [Plenty of journalists have confirmed this.](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/10/26/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-release-date-microtransactions-and-more/) (random example).

# --Reviews?--

Still no info. Many places expected to get review copies still haven't gotten them, including those that got to sample the preview (like ACG), however it's assumed the major places like IGN and Gamespot do have keys. No word on when, but probably next week.

# --Rapidfire Answers for the Questions You Keep Asking--

* Download size is \~70 gigs
* There will be a day 1 patch; details unknown, but stop freaking expecting another 70gigs in total file size, yeesh. The final, patched game probably won't go above 80 gigs total at launch.
* PS5 confirming preload on the 8th, the rest very likely to follow.
* Level cap has been most consistently described as being 50, but nothing has been officially confirmed. We surprisingly don't know much about attribute/perk gains.
* The game is almost entirely in first person, with third person only available in a very few cutscenes and while driving. This was done to be more immersive; the focus of the game is storytelling, not action.
* Ciri is not in the game; devs has said it a billion times and one of the leads is very against it, so if she is, they're lying lilies.
* This is supposed to be a dark game. You can turn off nudity, most explicit sexually suggestive stuff, and copyrighted music, but the game has earned its rating for a reason, so the toggles aren't going to lesson the excessive sexual and violence-based themes weaved deep into the narrative. These toggles are mostly intended for streamers and their fickle masters Twitch and YouTube.
* There are multiple endings; it is not known if you can get them all using one playthrough as a base (Like Deus Ex's hilariously infuriating ""pick an ending"" buttons).
* The 3 Lifepaths *all* ultimately meet at the same narrative point: **V becomes a novice mercenary with nothing to their name and Johnny Silverhand eventually in their heads**, though Lifepaths will continue to serve as a ""history"" that influences your character. They WILL NOT create 3 distinct play-throughs on their own outside of the prologue, but CDPR has said some quests and quest variations/options *will* be locked to a particular lifepath.
* ~~There are 4 (might have changed) difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard~~. The old, brief PS4 leaked footage shows Story, Easy, Normal, Hard now and so do some previews, though a [dev has mentioned very hard before](https://twitter.com/pjpkowski/status/1330244480210001920). There's supposed to be a hardcore mode but CDPR hasn't talked about it recently.
* CDPR will talk about the season passe and DLC after launch.
* This game **IS NOT** like GTA, however the **COMPARISON IS WORTHWHILE** as they DO share many similarities on the surface. Beyond that, however, Cyberpunk 2077 is a complete RPG closer to Fallout than GTA. You have stats to manage, weapons have damage values, your health is measured in numbers and so is all the damage you deal, enemies have levels and zones have levels ranges too. So unlike a shooter, where all combat is often based on skill, this is more like a typical RPG, where a much higher level enemy will almost always destroy you unless you're cheesing.
* The map is filled with tons to do; too much at once, some previewers felt. Both bigger, sprawling mini-story chains and small quick one-off stuff, and some side quests were described as being just as good as main quests.
* CDPR hasn't given a time for completion, but one of their QA guys was at \~150 hours on a nomad run, highest difficulty, and said he wasn't close to completing it, but remember QA guys play differently than most people.
* You can't join factions, gangs, or corporations; only fight against them or work with them.
* *Every* lifepath is deeply tied to the city and has roleplay options for any kind of character. Yes, even nomads. The nomad clans are one of the most powerful factions in Night City and have tons of people in the city, so they're not really outsiders. They also have stuff like an entire clan of netrunners, so yes you can safely play anything on any lifepath ""correctly"" according to lore.
* Nonlethal gameplay is confirmed. You can mod weapons to be nonlethal and spare bosses, as shown in the trailer while fighting Sasquatch. There's also a variety of damage types and bleeding/poison, possibly EMP-style afflictions too.
* The trunk of your car is linked to your apartment storage, so rejoice all you junk rats. Info came from one of the [randamo tweets they do sometimes](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/jgkb9c/first_post_ive_made_here_but_since_there_was_some/).
* Barbers haven't been confirmed in the game yet, but I honestly don't see why they won't be present when even Witcher 3 had them
* Police will react to you going on a rampage ""realistically"" using a notoriety system that's a bit more extensive and not quite as sharply dramatic as GTA's star system, but that should still give you a good idea of what to expect. Eventually, you'll be declared a cyberpsycho and Max-Tac, a legendary pseudo riot squad made up of borderline cyberpsychos, will hunt you down.
* Most NPCs are killable (and I guess sparable by extension); children can't be harmed and seemingly despawn when you're in a car. [This is unfortunate.](https://youtu.be/94m_P4-0wXw?t=237)
* CDPR has said that nearly every component of the HUD can be toggled on and off individually, like the damage numbers above people's heads when you hit them. It's unknown if we can customize things further (like have different eye-optics that change HUD color).
* CDPR wants to include a New Game Plus, but haven't talked much about it other [than saying they want to do it but don't know how](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-new-game-plus-cd-projekt-looking-fo/1100-6469267/). They've been saying the same thing since 2018, honestly. It might not make it in for release and be later free DLC.

Not sure if I forgot anything but feel free to ask and I'm sure me or someone else will answer, and I'll add it if it's worthwhile.

Hopefully this will cut down a bit on repeat questions as we ramp up toward release and more and more newer folk join us.";0;3262;3262;419;0;32
946;k3anze;Self;From this point forwards, r/Cyberpunkgame will only allow text posts, outside of 'free talk' days;2020-11-29;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k3anze/from_this_point_forwards_rcyberpunkgame_will_only/;"`Hey Choombas,`

The moderating team has decided that from now on, r/cyberpunkgame will only allow text posts, outside of 'free talk' days. We arrived at this decision because we felt that it would reduce the amount of low-effort posts made to the subreddit, while encouraging more high quality discussion. [This post gives some insight into our reasoning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k0wf0h/what_this_sub_will_be_filled_with_on_launch_day/)

In order to facilitate people sharing images, videos and links, we have a few options in place:

* First, leading up to launch, we will sticky and repost a *hype megathread* on a daily basis
   * This thread is for sharing pictures of countdowns, pre-orders and any other hype-related posts.
* Once the game comes out, we will sticky and repost a *media megathread* on a daily basis.
   * This thread will be for sharing screenshots and clips taken from the game.
      * Examples include, but are not limited to: character creator screenshots, loot screenshots, a cool kill you got, or a funny dialogue moment.
* ""But mod team, what if I want to post my screenshot/clip as it's own post?"" You can still do this, but in a text post, while writing a few sentences to describe the content.
   * If you are not able to describe the screenshot or clip in a few sentences (or more), then it is probably low-effort content and should be posted inside of the megathread. 
   * This is similar to link posts, like articles. If you cannot describe the content in at least a few sentences, then it's probably best not to make a new post about it.

However, all types of posts will be allowed during free talk days, *which will soon be changed to Saturday and Sunday, versus just Friday*.

We hope that this change is received well and look forward to hearing your feedback. As well, we will review this decision post-launch, depending on the feedback we get now and over the next few weeks.";0;2819;2819;323;0;12

790;k3hmxq;Video;Attributes and Perks in Cyberpunk 2077;2020-11-29;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k3hmxq/attributes_and_perks_in_cyberpunk_2077/;"I made a [video](https://youtu.be/YNSJwjoToWc) that goes over the what attributes and perks are in Cyberpunk, The feedback I got when I last posted here was very helpful and was hoping to get some on this. For those who do not want to watch you can read instead.

&#x200B;

# Attributes

There are a total of five different attributes in Cyberpunk. Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical and finally Cool. When you start the game you will have a total of 7 points to spread across the five as you see wish and as you level up you will have more, the max you can have an attribute is ~~10~~ 20 and the minimum is 3, it is also worth noting that stats will also come into play during dialogue, granting you options you other wise would not have such as intimidation. lets go over what each of them do!

**Body** is all about your strength and overall raw physical power, this attribute will increase your health, reduce the bullet spread of weapons, increase the damage you do with melee as well as increase your total stamina. This attribute will also allow you to gain access to perks for Shotguns, Two-handed, melee and athletics.

**Intelligence** is all about how well... intelligent you are. This attribute will make hacking easier, increase your memory pool (a resource used for hacking) and shorten program uploads, Intelligence is all about hacking so as expected will grant you access to hacking perks!

**Reflex** dictates your speed and coordination. This will increase crit rate, attack speed and evasion. It will also give you access to perks for Handguns, Rifles and blades.

**Technical Ability** is how familiar your character is with technology, the more you have the higher this attribute is, the higher your chance of finding craftable loot and your armour stat will be. as well as that you will have access to engineering perks with this attribute.

Lastly we have **Cool**, this attribute deals with your self-control and willpower. It will reduce how quickly you are spotted in stealth, boost your crit damage and improve you resistance to status effects. the perks for this attribute are for ~~sniper rifles,~~ (snipers now come under ""rifles"") assassination and nerve.

That is it for the attributes, next up lets get into the perks!

# Capstone Perks

~~There are a total of 60 perks in cyberpunk 2077, 5 for each skill and can be levelled up a total of 5 times~~  Rifles has 20 perks, Handguns has 20, and Blades has 17. That is already 57 perks, so there would have to be way more than just 60 perks. Also, all the perks have less than 5 levels expect the perks at the very bottom say 0+ (pointed out by u/BlaqkSkai). Those perks will provide you with stat boosts and the like e.g. extra damage with pistols or the ability to hack better cars. The way you gain access to these perks is by quite simple you level up what you want to be better at and you unlock a perk every 2 levels. However keep in mind that you are limited to what and how many perks you can have equipped by your attributes. For example a low reflex character will have much less options for pistol perks than a high reflex character. Now it would be a very long post if I wrote out 300 perks, not to mention you would probably just tune out and even then we don't know them all yet. so lets not do that, what we will instead do is go over the capstone perks, these are the perks you get by maxing out that skill to 10.

&#x200B;

Lets start with the **Body related skills**

Street Brawler will Increase your critical hit chance by 60% for 10 seconds after killing an enemy

Athletics will increase your armour and resistances by 20% for 10 seconds after being hit

and Annihilation will reduce recoil by 50% for 6 seconds after dismembering an enemy

&#x200B;

Next up the **Reflex skills**

Handguns will grant you an armour boost for 20 seconds upon hitting a crit

Rifles will nullify weapon sway and spread for 10 seconds when you kill an enemy

and Blades will deal 15% extra damage on a strong attack, consuming all stacked bleed effects

&#x200B;

Moving on we have **Intelligence skills**

Device Hacking will increase the time you have to breach when hacking by 25%

and Target Hacking will increase memory regeneration by 25%

&#x200B;

As for **Tech skills**

Crafting will increase sale prices of crafted items by 25%

and Engineering will increase your tech weapon dmg by 25%

&#x200B;

Finally we have **Cool skills**

Stealth will increase poison duration by 5 seconds

and Cold Blood will increase your crit chance by 10% and crit dmg by 2% while using Cold blood

&#x200B;

I think it was the same day that Xbox had their 2019 E3 conference (Keanu Reeves appeared on stage) when CDPR launched the pre-orders for all the game's editions june 9th 2019).

I remember that day I was in the movies while the pre-orders went live and obviously they were sold out in minutes. That night after the movie I was really bummed out that I couldn't pre-order the CE edition but I held unto hope that amazon may re-stock.

After several days, preying on the CE edition like a vulture I finally got a hold of a pre-order since June 27th of 2019. don't know about all of you but seems almost surreal that after 1.5 years later we have finally arrived to the last 10 days for launch.

Does anybody remember their pre-order experience? Or the date they finally got a confirmation of a pre-order of a certain edition?";0;33;33;62;0;0
390;k3wfnn;Love;A word of advice;2020-11-30;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k3wfnn/a_word_of_advice/;"Is to be patient with questions. The game is already getting compared to non-rpg games like GTA V and RDR2. This game is gonna attract a lot of people who have never played an rpg. I remember how much I struggled to understand all the systems thrown at me when I played The Witcher whether it is leveling, crafting, items, buffs, de-buffs and such. I always got lost not sure of how to progress or if I’m doing something wrong.

Both this subreddit and the game’s forums will fill up with questions during the early days of the game launch and some of these questions could be pretty obvious to you but it surely isn’t for the person asking. Therefore, give them an answer and don’t make fun of their questions like the typical responses “Are you blind” or pointing out that the questions is “dumb”.

I have always gotten a mixture of responses when I asked questions on forums back when I played The Witcher varying from very helpful and insightful ones to people making fun of the question and turning it into a shitposting thread/post.

With the popularity of this game, we can predict how Cyberpunk 2077 will be the first rpg of many people so lets keep it positive!";0;1636;1636;357;0;4

The moderating team has decided to put the subreddit into *approve-only* mode. This means that all posts need to be manually approved by a moderator before they hit /new.

Unfortunately, more leaks have started to make their way onto the internet and we feel that it's much better to move into approve-only mode too early, rather than too late.

In all likelihood, we will stay into approve-only mode from now, until a few weeks after launch.

This is also a good opportunity to repeat the subreddit's stance on spoilers:

* Discussion, sharing and requesting of leaked spoilers is unallowed without exception

Then I realized that there is a real possibility that many of us will actually still be alive in 2077, and this game will have been 57 years old. I mean that is, if we ever make it to the dark future.

Either way, hope you all enjoy the game!

Edit: Maaaaybeee saying ""many"" of us was in fact a bold statement, some of us, and some of our kids...

Edit #2: I'll be 88 if I live that long, if we live that long.... I get that's like a high number to make it to but surprised how many of you don't want to live that long. I get it though, health and the state of the world depending.

Edit #3: Okay I think last one, we will all die one day, it's a part of life, my goal wasn't to throw this grim message out there but the opposite, in a week we can all escape into night city and carve out own paths. Although it's currently just single player just imagine how everyone will be connected and playing at the same time. I'm excited to share things with others and see all the different stories that CDPR has crafted for us. Either way, see you there.";0;2836;2836;540;0;2

Especially with the final previews coming out a week or so ago, review copies out there to outlets, and people getting the game early. 

Not looking for any spoilers whatsoever when it comes to the story but I thought I saw someone mention that there was some kind of “bars that fill up” and you need to fill three of them up to get to the last mission in the game? To be honest I had no idea what this meant. 

I’m hoping for a lengthy campaign with tons of side content not a shortened campaign with tons of side content. I’d love to be lost in Night City for crap tons of time. But the three bars being discussed filling up as you do quests was throwing me off.";0;17;17;84;0;0

194;k6b6ye;News;Car customization, Character Creation, Next Gen Upgrade - Polish Interview with Sebastian Kalemba, Head of Animation at CDPR;2020-12-03;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k6b6ye/car_customization_character_creation_next_gen/;"[Interview](https://youtu.be/j7ATxN2CYPw)

The most interesting bits for me, personally:

\- CDPR didn't plan on doing Car Customization, idea was in back of their heads, but it was super low priority so they quickly forgot about it. Some of the devs (including the one giving interview) were shocked so many people wanted Car Customization.

\- Character Creator is done in a way it's super easy to implement any new bits and pieces so it's really comfortable for devs to add to it. That's why they're wondering about adding new stuff in the future.

\- Life Paths and special dialogue choices have ""under the carpet"" influence on your relationships with characters and can block or unlock romances or sex scenes.

\- We can't control flying cars... for now ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

\- Not every song was made for Cyberpunk 2077, they bought some licenses here and there (e.g. Grimes track)

\- He belives next gen upgrade should come soon

\- Played for 6 weeks on original PS4 and was having a blast (his product of course but guy seemed so down to earth I believe him for some reason)

\- He wanted to have at least a little bit of fun so he decided to know nothing about easter eggs. He believes there will be tons of those in game

\- He loved sound design in GTA V.

\- There will be New Game Plus

Edit:
\- I remembered there was one interesting thing I forgot to mention. Guy doing interview, actually played 4 hour demo in June and he mentioned he could literally stand on NPCs head while talking to them (thanks to more open in movement dialogue system) and he asked if they plan on adding stuff where certain NPC would react to that. Kalemba said they previously thought about making such NPC stop talking to you, fail a quest or just attack you on the spot but CDPR decided to abandon it. Mostly because only a small percentege of players would actually do such things and people who acidentally steped on NPC (or just jumped on the table or something) would be unfairly punished.

Sorry for writing origial post without this interesting bit but it was pretty late for me and I just rewatched it for the 2nd time.";0;1045;1045;360;0;1

* Hype posts, like, ‘This is Why I’m so Excited for Cyberpunk 2077
* Battlestation posts, sharing your PC or console setup with a Cyberpunk 2077 theme

We will also be relaxing our moderation of rule 7, which means that you can post your Cyberpunk 2077 themed memes! Please note that they will still be subject to removal due to user reports.";0;187;187;377;0;2

Amazon offers release date delivery for pre-order products shipped and sold by them and when messaging support they told me this was a technical error and they couldn't supervene the charge but credited my account a $5 coupon.

A lot of people are saying that it's gonna be a let down but with all the games that released this year being a let down I have faith that it won't be.

I know cyberpunk will be good in my opinion because I've always enjoyed playing the Witcher 3 and with the same developers I know its gonna be great. A game to just get lost in as I did in the Witcher 3. Everyone this year has done a great job with everything happening with Covid-19 and now its time for the end of the year game to have a happy ending to 2020.

Some people say the game is not gonna be very good but to be honest in my opinion I don't care about the gameplay or story what has always fascinated me was the concept of the game. Transhumanisim and a futuristic world what more could you want honestly.

But as the game comes close to launch I hope everyone who gets to play this game has an amazing time like I'm going to have because this game is going to be beautiful.

409;k85pfo;Question;What’s your first move?;2020-12-06;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k85pfo/whats_your_first_move/;"So we’re all getting super excited. I’m getting super excited. I’M SO EXCITED. 

I’ve never been so excited about a video game.

I remember playing the original Assassins Creed when it came out. When they announced ACII, I freaked. 

I remember when San Andreas was announced. Beyond excited. 

But this- this is different. This is sooo different. 

So here’s my question- what’s your first move? What’s the first thing you’re gonna try to do? Steal a car and sell it for the ripperdoc fee? Take a little contract? Go boozing with Jackie? Or are you gonna go chase after Judy?  It’s all life path dependent, sure, and there’s the prologue to get through, and that’ll change things. 

But what’s it gonna be, choombas? What’s your move?";0;285;285;361;0;3

i can only do 1 person !

—  also want to add im doing this because for some getting to play day 1 wont be a reality . Life can be stressful. i use to game allot an ran into that problem once or twice, & recently i personally been wanting a game i could play and just take my mind off of other things , this is that game. sometimes you just want to escape .

i understand its the internet guys, 
some might lie. But im sure their are legit ppl on here who would be more then happy to receive it , due to certain circumstances ..

If ppl are really going to lie though that would be pretty low..

However, not here to decipher ever single msg to see whos being honest

plenty of legit ones ive come across and keeping track of.
many of you are saying to gift to a friend and such, as it would mean allot more.

I was planning on buying digital for the convenience and to make the swap to next gen easier but after seeing that I’m wondering if getting the disc would be a better choice. 

Also, they mention dlc and to visit a website in the promo material, I assume the free dlc won’t require a code or anything and will be easily available on the digital versions?

In one sense, it’s one of those consequences of the tough development grind on an open-world game. In another, it tells us something interesting about how developer CD Projekt RED has chosen to build its future dystopia.

' As was the case in *The Witcher* series, side quests are not so much short deviations from the main story, but instead serve as complimentary pieces that overlap and intertwine with its narrative. They make *Cyberpunk* more about the journey and less about the destination. Having bypassed many of them in a bid to get through the campaign for the sake of this review, I learned the hard way that this may not have been the best approach; after roughly 36 hours, I watched end credits roll and by that time I had barely unlocked half of the perks available to any one of the character traits available. I fell well short of earning enough eddies (aka currency) to apply more than just a few cybernetic enhancements to my character. It left me feeling that either the game has some serious issues with balancing, or perhaps I just didn’t play it “the right way”. Looking over the quest log — which shows the tasks I’ve yet to complete — I’d estimate roughly a further 20 or 30 hours of gameplay could come from side quests alone. In short, take your time with this one. '

>Cyberpunk 2077 is the ultimate power fantasy. A video game that takes the best of modern RPG, first-person shooter, stealth, and the open world and masterfully blends it into a single product. If Skyrim and GTA V marked a before and after for their genres at the beginning of the 2010s, Cyberpunk 2077 is called to do the same from this 2020.

>It's definitely feels like with Cyberpunk 2077 CD Projekt RED tried to tell a really meaningful story, while using as a backdrop truly a unique setting. And all the while the developers made sure that the game still feels approachable by all kind of people, and that it presents itself with insane graphical fidelity painting an image of an eerily realistic world of tommorow. We doubt there's too many people who don't believe in CD Projekt RED, but in case you're one of them, be warned - Cyberpunk 2077 is something that will change the way you look at the gaming industry as a whole.

>Cyberpunk 2077 is a new masterpiece from CD Projekt RED, a huge, dense, vibrant, colorfoul and dark Sci-Fi RPG that any fan of the genre should step in. First because it will provide the sensation that the story really depends on you choices and that you have everything you need for your playstyle. Then because streets, stores, buildings, inhabitants of Night City won't get out of your head easily.

Although my first dozen hours with the game has been marred by easy-to-fix problems, Nighty City, along with all it offers and all that call it home, makes for an intoxicating escape. Here's hoping the next one hundred hours are as utterly compelling.

>Cyberpunk 2077 is a wild journey within an incredibly fascinating setting; some technical uncertainties  destined to disappear and a partial repetitiveness limit its glory, but overall it is an adventure worthy of William Gibson himself. Cyberpunk 2077 allowed me to finally feel immersed in that pen & paper RPG I discovered in 1988, pouring rain clouding my view in a kaleidoscope of neon signs, just as I had imagined while leafing through those pages. Some may not consider it a perfect game, but I do.

>I’m V and the game is Silverhand - I can’t get Cyberpunk 2077 out of my head. I’ve had it a week and played 70 hours, which is probably about as healthy as scooping out my face and replacing it with electronics, but it didn’t feel like work.

>In the midst of such intense anticipation and scrutiny, it’s easy to get carried away with what Cyberpunk 2077 could have been. The final experience might be more familiar than many predicted, with plenty of elements that aren’t perfect, but it’s dripping with detail and engaging stories.

883;k8ab56;Meta;Just some advice from a old gamer to you;2020-12-07;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k8ab56/just_some_advice_from_a_old_gamer_to_you/;"In short, have fun! Enjoy yourself, every single moment of it.

Don't let your opinion of the game be altered by YouTube or other media platforms. When I was younger I used to turn myself off of my own hype with other titles by letting their complaints influence my own experiences only to find out later mine were not the same and enjoyed it. Like most things this game will not be for everyone. They never are, regardless of how much hype is built up around it. Just take Skyrim for example, one of the most popular RPGs I've ever played but there are people who to this day still say it sucks. Games, movies, TV, etc.. Everyone has an opinion and opinion is just that. You may like pineapple on pizza, and while I think you're a psychopath for it, that doesn't mean you're wrong for liking it.. Life is short, enjoy these times because tomorrow isn't guaranteed.

It's easy to get sucked into things people complain about and turn your normally positive experience into a negative one. Most of us have been waiting on this title for ~7 years now. The hype for the game is obviously super high and I'm sure some will be critical regardless of how it turns out. Back even when I used to stream I actually had branded myself in preparation for this but ultimately decided to stop streaming, mostly because of time and games like this easily spoiled by chat trolls. I opted this week and into the future weeks/months I'll be enjoying this on my own with nobody watching and looking forward to seeing how you all play as well after I'm finished with my first playthrough.

I hope you all make the best of whatever your choices are, I hope you are all safe in real life, especially with the stress and safety of the real world right now. Immerse yourself, enjoy yourself and burn the city down samurai!

Edit: Thank you for the awards, first time getting gold before. You guys are awesome. I'm glad that my post helped have some meaning for everyone in this very passionate community and I really didn't expect it to get so much conversation.";0;837;837;151;0;10

Has there been any further mention of these types of random encounters? 

Having watched a lot of the trailers/official videos there are things like the trauma teams and the MAX-TAC that they showed off where it is hard to tell whether these encounters were purely scripted for that mission or whether you can encounter those sorts of events at random.

Granted a game with compelling story and brilliant set pieces is good but I'm also a fan of all the dynamic stuff in the world happening at random.";0;41;41;33;0;0

I honestly never thought there could be this much love in a gaming community. I owe you all so much for being supportive and helping me get through these times. You guys give me hope and show me that there is still good in this world. So many lovely comments from lovely people. I'm already daydreaming about my playthrough for the launch day.

I'm so emotional right now. I'll be thinking of this community every time I'm driving in Night City.
Thanks to all of you.

Edit: Thanks again for the awards people. If you're willing to spend, you can scroll through the comments and see some people really struggling. Like someone cancelling their preorder bc of losing their job or someone else having a brain surgery. If you can, maybe help them out. Many people asked to help me so I'm sure there are some of you still out there who would help them out too. The world needs more love during these hard times.

Game informer has put out an epilepsy psa for Cyberpunk that contains information on what to avoid and when it comes so it won't trigger a seizure.

If you can't read it, here's the basics: red glitching animations are common, clubs and bars are ""danger zones"", interactions with Johnny Silverhand are marked by a ""flickering pale blue glitch effect.""  Braindance is constantly a threat, as the head set has been modeled off of a device ment to ""trigger a seizure when they need to trigger one for diagnosis purposes."" It did in fact cause the author to have a seizure. The core of Braindance is also dangerous as there are ""specific glitch animations that could be a danger, especially with the digitized layer.""

I hope this information can help someone and that all of you, with epilepsy and without, stay safe playing Cyberpunk 2077.";0;2604;2604;783;0;9

It could've been a 6/10 game where the gameplay leaves nothing to be desired, the story gets boring and it isn't fun.

Thank god we're going to get another witcher 3 scenario where the game starts amazing but buggy, then becomes (hopefully) one of the best games in a year thanks to the bug fixes and DLCs.

If you're upset about hearing that the game has bugs, just remember, it could've been SO much worse. We really did get the best of a bad situation. Bugs are fixable, bad gameplay is not.

**Edit: Some people are confused with the intent of this post so allow me to clear it up:**

**I am not saying that the bugs should be ignored or excused because they can be patched. If the bugs are prominent, and they ruin the experience of playing the game, then yes, CDPR should recieve justified critisism for it. I'm simply stating that, since it is mostly the bugs that are at issue, they can be fixed and the final Cyberpunk 2077 product in a year's time will be similar to the witcher 3's now, a very good game.**";0;10054;10054;2062;0;66

I mean the game could come out and be a bug-less masterpiece so who knows but reviewers are saying pretty much the only negative is the bugs, which there seems to be a lot of. In fact I want to be wrong but I doubt I will be in this case

I see many comments saying “Day 1 patch will fix most things” and although I live the optimism, I doubt it’ll fix the copious amount of bugs detailed

I’m still expecting many bugs and playing on the Xbone one, there will be spade fulls of it and that’s fine I guess

Just don’t hype yourself thinking it will be flawless, we all want it to be but CDPR has been very cautious about reviewers own footage and that speaks volumes

I’m super, super hyped and my friends honestly have wanted me to shut up about it for the past 6 months so I’m as excited as you guys, it’s just I also want to be realistic

Edit: It’s not a huge problem if there’s bugs. I’ve played through Fallout 4 multiple times and played 1000 hours of Ark so I’m used to it, just saying we shouldn’t expect bugs to magically disappear";0;13025;13025;2448;2;42

Like many of you, I am looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077 and am excited. It should be of no surprise that a game set in a world like this would feature many bright and flashing lights. However, this kind of thing can prove to be immensely harmful for players who suffer from epileptic seizures, as Liana Ruppert did, during her epileptic seizure PSA.   


Is there some sort of accessibility option that will be available at launch, or at least in the works, that will help players who suffer from seizures, to be able to play the game with minimal fear of having this triggered?

Changing from low to high on most other settings did not yield much difference, we're talking single digits. I think this is why running everything at high is making the game run like dogpoo.

982;ka504y;Self;How To Rebind The Unrebindable Controls;2020-12-09;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/ka504y/how_to_rebind_the_unrebindable_controls/;"If you use ESDF or want to try binding something to [the arrow keys](https://twitter.com/GopherGaming/status/1336672981037277188) then you've probably noticed a pretty big problem with rebinding the controls. If you try to bind something to ""f"" the game won't let you. It also won't let you bind things to the up and down arrows. 

The problem is that the game doesn't show you every control in the key bindings menu. Specifically, there are some things bound to these keys that aren't shown in the settings menu. For example, the ""takedown button"" is bound to ""f"" but you can't change this in the settings menu. 

In order to fix this you need to go to ""<Cyberpunk Game Directory>/r6/config"" and open ""inputUserMappings.xml"". This is every control in the game — including the ones not shown in the key bindings menu. 

In my case, I got ESDF working by changing the ""takedown"" button from ""f"" to ""g"". Search for ""Takedown_Button"" in the file and change the second button id from ""IK_F"" to ""IK_G"". You can then go back in game and rebind keys to ""f"".

---

Edit: Any custom key bindings made in game are stored in the `C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Local\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077\UserSettings.json` file. You can also edit this file in a text editor. When reading it, the `""value"": ""IK_Key""` part is the custom mapping made in game and the `""default_value"": ""IK_Key""` part is the default value of the keybinding. 

You can use this to find out what the ""IK_"" code is for any key. Simply bind it in game and then find that binding in this file.";0;274;274;206;0;5

47;k9qjgt;Discussion;The way that Cyberpunk 2077 development and reviews have been handled signals that the mainstream gaming media needs to change their approach to reviewing games and game development needs to change;2020-12-09;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/k9qjgt/the_way_that_cyberpunk_2077_development_and/;"I am beyond hyped for Cyberpunk, it's preloaded from GOG, just teasing me with that [play button that works](https://i.imgur.com/J5ZKBvF.jpg).

Regardless if you are a die hard fan or not, the way that reviews have been handled by the media is misguided, and the way that CD Projekt Red handled it is downright deceitful.

* PC reviewers were not allowed to use their own footage
* Tom's Hardware was asked to have their benchmarks removed due to poorly implemented DRM
* No console copies were sent out for review

In the latest trailer [published yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnA7tepsc7s&feature=youtu.be), the trailer [published two weeks ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO8lX3hDU30), and even trailers [from 5 months ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixl31324UxE). They all end with the same thing, ""Pre-Order"".

They are actively marketing and asking for you to pre-order. Regardless of Day 0/1/2/3 patches, they are asking you to pre-order something that comes as a physical item for most people getting it.

When Cyberpunk 2077 went gold, then they should have had the game in a state that it would be sent to reviewers. Instead from leaked footage. *By leaked footage I mean that this is gameplay footage of the data that shipped with the physical copy for the Xbox, uploaded before release day. So if someone lives out in the sticks with barely good internet or do not have reliable access to the internet then that is the game they have.*

We can see that the game was not ready to ship, at all, period.

Things need to change, this is one of the most hyped games I have ever seen, but I feel so many people on the PS4 and Xbox One are just being lied to and are set for disappointment. Some probably will be so disappointed that they will be in disbelief and think something else is wrong.

Things need to change, even if it is an industry wide gentlemen's agreement.

* Reviews should be made from the gold standard
* Publishers should get the review copy a month before release
* Every launch platform should have review copies distributed

In addition to that, gaming media should,

* Not publish a review of a game they have not had adequate time to review and give it a score
* Reviews should not take into account patches coming in the future

It's just insane the amount of hype this game has with it's troubled development of being delayed *three* times, people working [six day work weeks since September](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-09-30-cyberpunk-2077-developer-will-force-six-day-weeks-leading-up-to-launch#:~:text=Cyberpunk%202077%20developer%20will%20force%20six%2Dday%20weeks%20leading%20up%20to%20launch,-After%20previously%20saying&text=Cyberpunk%202077%20developer%20CD%20Projekt,overtime%20to%20finish%20the%20project.) (with the game being delayed again during that period), reports of [people looking physically ill](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1321140689309175808) making a **video game**. And for all that work, the videos above are what shipped on that disc.

Feel free to brigade, doxx, and downvote, but I've said my piece and this game's success or failure is made with lies and blood. Fitting for the world it portrays.

I understand that the developers are aware that there are a number of bugs and I am also sympathetic that the last year of development was plagued with coronavirus issues but still - I have NEVER seen a game so poorly optimised from a technical perspective.

The main argument from most reviewers was that the choices the player makes during side quests (no matter how cool) both narrarivley and mechanically aren't meaningfully reflected in V's main character arc. This is especially hard to swallow in a game which centers player choice, a dynamic open world, and RPG mechanics.

Reviewers also focus on how potentially deep themes are only interesting at the conceptual stage and aren't further explored in a meaningful way. 

These flaws taken together create a feeling of frivolity towards the side quests and obscure the creator's thematic intent. 

Not even to mention the bugs!

These seem like pretty legitimate criticisms for an RPG...

There’s a lot of credit to be given to forefathers like William Gibson and the aesthetic masterpiece that is Blade Runner, but Mike’s specific vision for cyberpunk and the icon that is Johnny Silverhand is fucking brilliant, not to mention all of the creativity and inclusivity/diversity being a biproduct of a POC creator is an inspiration to any aspiring creative, minority or otherwise

Looking forward to diving into this incredibly fucked up world come tomorrow. Thanks for everything Mike, it really is a thing of beauty!!!

Edit: A few people seem to have taken an issue with my “POC” comment (and quite a few have resorted to DMing me racial slurs and calling me a SJW cuck) so I wanna quickly address it — I’m black myself and was just tryna express that I’m really fucking happy another black creative is seeing such immense success and it’s really inspirational to me since there isn’t as much representation out there on that scale as I’d like. Wasn’t implying that it’s ONLY because he’s black or that black people can’t be creative or anything ludicrous as that, was only tryna say that the complex issues in Cyberpunk 2077’s original lore revolving around sex workers and cultural appropriation are amazing given that Mike is a minority himself so those views are obviously informed by his own personal experiences/worldview. It just adds another layer of poignant authenticity to it.

This will be a work-in-progress. However, I set it to ""view only"" to prevent trolls from trolling, but comment here if you find another setting that definitely needs to be changed.

Please reach out to me if you're really passionate about this kind of thing and would like to have editing access. I am in grad school and probably won't be able to keep up with popular suggestions. I think the only changes added to this document should be those that bring significant improvements in gaming experience with minimal downsides.

Ideally, the mods will sticky this for all to see. Upvote for visibility.

Edit: For mobile users who see the Google doc's text vertically, try rotating your phone horizontally or download the Google Docs app. This supposedly fixed it for some people.

Edit 3: Many people asking ""why not include crowd density?"" I wanted to leave out setting changes that will visibly change gameplay. The aim is to improve your FPS and visuals without leaving you feeling like anything is actually missing. Although, I think it'd be a good idea to add another section organizing a tiered list of best settings to sacrifice for those in more need. Also, plz DM if you wanna help edit the doc.

842;katf3h;Meta;Some fans are reaching total absurdity here.;2020-12-10;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/katf3h/some_fans_are_reaching_total_absurdity_here/;"PS4 players are being told the deplorable performance of their game on consoles is somehow their fault, as they are attempting to ""run a next-gen game on a 7-year-old console"". This, of course, ignoring it was CDPR who chose to design, market and release the game on that very console. The game's planning had begun *before* the PS4 even released. The game built up substantial expectation *during* its first years. If it has arrived ""too late"", it's on the CDPR project managers. A release on that console was promised when it was feasible, and was sworn to be feasible. CDPR, late into the decade, even claimed PS3 performance was ""surprisingly good""! To think some Cyberpunk fans are doing damage control for CDPR's fraud for free is hilarious, considering it should be their PR team pulling damage control, *not you guys*.

Somehow, people keep claiming this ""next-gen of gaming"" is worth the hussle. In order to play at a stable 60FPS at 1080p, no less than a 1080 should be advised. In fact, one should think of an RTX 2060 just to be sure. However, CDPR proudly announced a GTX 1060, a 2016 GPU, would be enough to run it on ""recommended"". ""Recommended"": I am shocked to find most people seem to think the industry standard for ""recommended"" is meant to be an unstable, choppy playthrough. Let us not forget that, according to Steam, [the GTX 1060 is the most popular GPU at the moment](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam), a convenient statistic for the marketing team to make use of. The world wonders whether CDPR knew they could maximize sales by not discouraging gamers who are skeptical about their PCs' performance.

Some have said it's the *community's fault* that this is a wreck. Overhyping, you say? CDPR has repeatedly fueled the fire in interviews, investor calls and social media. Don't you understand? Your hype was their project's commercial success. They aren't a benevolent group of gamer-loving philanthropists. You've upvoted posts to the front page of this sub, which tell people to ""delay the game yourself"" (as in, waiting) or to ""stop overhyping"" as if **each and every one of CDPR's promises** hadn't been made with pure hype and PR in mind. When you perpetuate these myths that they are some industry prodigies, you do more PR for them than their actual PR team! And when you bar the critics from calling them out with an arsenal of half-cooked excuses, you do what the underpaid intern over and Twitter is supposed to do: to defend the indefensible. You were promised a good game. Demand a good game!

And then, *this* what we have received is supposed to be the justification for the crunches, the delays, the nonsense. Many devs behind The Witcher 3 left [after similarly unreasonable conditions forced them to](https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2077-cdpr-cd-projekt-red-crunch/). You know, deep down below, that the reason codes for console reviewers weren't sent out is, very likely, because it would've popped the pre-order and day one purchase bubble. If EA had done this, the world would be up in arms -- but your false prophets at Poland somehow get a pass.

Lastly, there is this blind faith in ""the patch of patches"", which will somehow fix the game entirely. The most rabid fans will go to great lengths to deny whatever flaw; but, if they somehow agree, they'll dismiss it as something to be patched out soon enough. The issue, perhaps, is that fundamental concerns about AI behaviour or engine physics cannot be simply ""patched up"". Hell, even graphical issues have their weight: a missing texture is a nuisance, but a design flaw in them, or a generalized issue with their rendering, is no trivial matter.

It makes no sense for people to justify their irresponsible, deliberately fueled hype train.

It makes no sense for people to legitimize their anti-consumer lies about graphics quality.

It makes no sense for people to trivialize their harsh treatment of employees, bent under crunches for the sake of a product that never was worth the struggle.

It makes no sense for people to form this idiotic cult around a product, a brand, a studio and the bitches they'll buy with your pre-order money.

I'm a long-time fan of the cyberpunk genre, and have followed this game closely. I am disappointed, sure, but I still see its virtues, both present and potential. I believe in this game. What I don't believe in is the *absolute lies* some of you will spread to defend what mustn't be defended, but understood and criticized rationally. This cultish behaviour is an embarrassment.";0;1799;1799;323;0;11

**EDIT 2: I just found out about this fix by reddit user** u/oppai **for virtual input not being accepted**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kb73fr/fix\_for\_virtual\_input\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kb73fr/fix_for_virtual_input_not_working/)

The fix works perfectly for me. I tried it with **GlovePIE**, **Autohotkey** and **IRIS**. Please let us know if it works for you guys.

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot u/oppai :)

&#x200B;

**EDIT 1:**

C*larification:* I can't move my hands because of a muscular distrophy. I can press 4 mouse buttons with my toes and move the mouse cursor with a head mouse.

I'm using GlovePIE and Autohotkey to remap those 4 buttons so I can virtually ""press""/emulate 10 to 15 keys.

On top of that I'm using IRIS with a Tobii Eye Tracker 4C. This makes it possible to ""press"" virtual keys by looking at customized areas of the screen. This adds another 10 to 15 virtual keys. Without these 3 tools I have only 4 buttons left which makes the game unplayable.

&#x200B;

*Stadia*: I keep reading posts of people that play Cyberpunk 2077 on Stadia.

Could any of those people try to use Autohotkey or similar software that sends virtual keys to the game on Stadia?

However, they didnt have to release it on current gen if it wasn't going to work. 

The nerve of CD today saying ""The journey has just begun!""...no, the journey just didn't begin. It began when you hyped this game up for years and years and when you charged money for it. I know nothing about making games and I'm not saying hard work hasnt been done. I'm sure it'll get patched over time. But for consoles, it's a mess and of course they knew this.

My ""journey"" is me getting a refund and maybe returning to it later when I'm less annoyed, and if you are too, that's perfectly valid.

For all of the posts discussing the state of the game, (not necessarily reporting bugs), we want you to use this thread to share your thoughts, good, bad or ugly, rather than submitting a new post each time.

""Don't worry, the day 1 patch will address those issues"" was the common response, and that's assuming that you didn't believe that someone claiming to have the game early was lying. And yet through all that time, CDPR flat-out refused to let ANY footage of last-gen versions of the game be shown. Why? Were they not confident? Would the game truly run as early owners claimed, or were those people lying/exaggerating?

Well, Day 1 is officially upon us. We have the patch, we have the game, and we are INCREDIBLY let down by what we're seeing. Look, obviously the game won't look as good as it does on PC. No one expected that. Yes, we know the upgraded versions of last gen consoles and current gen will run games better than the base versions. But what we have here is insulting, and a slap in the face to all of us that haven't upgraded and trusted CD Projekt Red because of their reputation. Nothing about this game runs ""surprisingly well."" Hell, I'm surprised that the game ended up running WORSE than I expected based on reports from early owners. So here we are, with a game that struggles to maintain even 20 frames per second, blurry graphics that are hard on the eyes, and the pop-in is atrocious and immersion breaking. 30 minutes into the game I'd already caught the attention of law enforcement for crashing into a pedestrian that didn't even show up until about five seconds after I hit him.

You know what it reminds me of? When I was on vacation, I brought my shitty laptop along with me and tried running games at below the minimum recommended PC settings. Of course they ran horribly. And yet that's the only thing that I can compare Cyberpunk 2077 on Playstation 4 with: A game that clearly wasn't designed with my outdated hardware in mind. Fine. So why didn't they TELL US instead of reassuring their entire fanbase that the game will run surprisingly well on our last-gen consoles after the day 1 patch? Hell, how about just don't release it on the older hardware if it can't run the game at an acceptable level? Sure, that decision would hurt their reputation. But you know what hurts their reputation even more? Promising us that the game would run fine on our older consoles, only for us to find out after buying the game that the optimization is terrible.

I don't want to say that the game has the worst graphics on PS4/XB1, but it is one of the worst looking games on those consoles if that makes sense. What I mean by that is that the game's graphics are clearly good. That's the problem. Those consoles can't keep up with those graphics and so they run the game poorly instead, and it breaks any sense of immersion. That's what I mean when I say that it's one of the poorest looking games that I've seen in a while. That sucks, because clearly there is a good game buried underneath all of this crap... but it's just so damn hard to enjoy the good things when the game runs so terribly that it's distracting.

CD Projekt Red, you clearly have a lot on your plate after this launch. Bugs are certainly an issue, and I'm sure those will be addressed. But what about those of us on last-gen consoles that paid full price for a game that doesn't run at anything close to an acceptable level? I'd really like to know what the developers plan to do about this. Is there even anything that they can do, or will the consoles forever be doomed to not play the game properly due to outdated hardware? We bought your product because we trusted you when you said that the game would run ""surprisingly well"" for us, and we've seen the exact opposite of that. You owe us an explanation, and we would really like to know what you plan to do for those of us that haven't upgraded consoles that expected you to deliver on your promise.

Sincerely,

Playstation 4 and Xbox One owners

Edit: Thank you so much for the awards and upvotes. I never in my wildest dreams expected to post anything on Reddit that got over 100 upvotes, and I really appreciate the feedback. Not all of it has been good though, and I've gotten some pretty nasty messages. I don't mind though. I just find it sad.

Also, I will no longer be replying to anyone that blames consumers for expecting the game to run well on Playstation 4 and Xbox One. I've tried being reasonable with my responses as to why we have every right to be disappointed, and it just isn't going anywhere. So you're free to keep calling people ""idiots"" for thinking that PS4 and XB1 versions would run well when CDPR told us that it would, but I'm done responding to it.

Final note:  This thread is getting some responses from gamers running Cyberpunk on a base PS4 or XB1 that don't have any gripes with the game. From the bottom of my heart I am honestly happy for you and hope that you continue to enjoy the experience. I never accused this of being a bad game, and I'm indeed still playing it myself despite what I consider to be immersion-breaking issues. There's fun to be had, and I'm hopeful that CDPR can get this thing running better so that we can all just shut up and enjoy this game. :)";0;6696;6696;1772;1;43
55;karjew;Discussion;PSA: CDPR IS no longer calling Cyberpunk 2077 an 'RPG' and is now calling it an 'Action-Adventure' game.;2020-12-10;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/karjew/psa_cdpr_is_no_longer_calling_cyberpunk_2077_an/;"**TL;DR Game was marketed the last two years an RPG that includes content thats no longer in the game, they have suddenly started calling it an 'Action-Adventure' game and scrubbed 'RPG' from many of their marketing material. This is incredibly misleading.** 

If you go back and look at the marketing starting in 2018, not only did CDPR heavily market this game as an RPG, but there are also a number of features removed/missing. I would like to go back and find the interviews but CDPR themselves hyped this game up as being a better and more deep RPG and narrative experience than the Witcher.

Some missing features include:

- Cut Spider bot gameplay

- Cut Techie skill tree

- Wall Running

- Cut Apartment and car customization

- Cut subway (now just fast travel with loading screen)

- Cut wardrobe, now it all happens in inventory

- No haircuts or ~~visible~~  *customizable* body augmentations 

Just to name a few.

If you look at the marketing materials from the past couple months you might notice that the word “RPG” was almost flat out removed from the messaging despite them referring to the game as such up until a couple of months ago. On CP2077’s own launch trailer on YouTube, Twitter bio, etc. you can see that they're now calling Cyberpunk 2077 as an ""Open world action-adventure game"".

This wouldn’t be such an issue had CDPR made that very clear years ago. But instead they quietly scrubbed the word from their messaging, dumbed down RPG mechanics, made dialogue options more limited than before, and instead we have this weird mish-mash of poorly fleshed out GTA and Borderlands-esque gameplay mechanics while also attempting to be an RPG. Even though they continued to market RPG mechanics and other cut content that didn't make it into the game.

I have no idea what this game is trying to be, but an evolution of what made The Witcher 3 so praised? I don’t think so. Many of us came into this game expecting an RPG similar in quality to the Witcher 3 - I don’t know about you but that was my only real expectation and that is absolutely not what we got. So much of the marketing over the past 2 years does not reflect the current state of this game at all, and I’m not just referring to bugs. I bought this game because it was supposed to be an RPG, not an action game.

Now what? Can we even consider this an RPG? Is it trying to be one or something else? Does that mean we can no longer compare it previous RPGs when critiquing? Have we been mislead?

CDPR has completely pulled a bait and switch here.";0;7945;7945;2682;0;20

I am having a blast so far with zero issues aside from small performance problems, which is completely normal. 

The rage culture of gaming nowadays is getting out of hand. People have all this high expectations for games to be big free and work perfectly.

They said the game barely has any bugs, people won't even notice unless they're looking really hard - it's a meme now

No, they didn't just promise a ""good"" game, they didn't market a ""good"" game, nor a ""nice"" or a ""pretty ok"" or a ""kinda fun"" one.

""Do you want a game that's an eight or nine... or a ten?""  
""I suspect the story will leave you an emotional wreck""  
""Okay, we get it, Witcher was good, but boy, when Cyberpunk drops, these top RPGs lists will be shuffled...""  
""Stealth AI will immersively react to the noises the player makes differently based on the environment, we gave different objects different values based on opacity and material to...""  
""Every time we make a game, we aim to reinvent the wheel, we understand that that kind of work ethic isn't for everyone, but outside of the comfort zone is where the magic happens...""

Not my words. Official dev tweets, Q&As, interviews, investor calls, what have you.The game was hyped and marketed up as it was going to be the best videogame of the last generation.

When it launches with so many technical issues and underwhelming features beyond just ""bugs"", people will have a reaction.

Fanboys will damage-control, players will feel let down, haters who prayed for the game to fail will swarm over, some will still enjoy the game.

But the game underdelivering for so many people isn't because said people had over the top expectations.  
Not directly, that is, the game was deliberately marketed to create a historical amount of hype to get as many people pre-ordering and on board for a launch day purchase as possible.

This is why they didn't show unedited gameplay to the public since 2018: the game wasn't in a shape to be shown off.

A game like this one was supposed to be isn't made in 5 years by a studio with only one AAA title out, it being their first open world game.";0;7580;7580;2861;0;18
709;kb9ofj;Video;This game really makes you appreciate the complexity of GTA and RDR characters. And how good the animations are.;2020-12-11;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kb9ofj/this_game_really_makes_you_appreciate_the/;"The cardboards characters in this game are very annoying. I dislike how little interactions there are in NPCs. If you look at them long enough they disappear. If I walk in the city, 99% of people are just standing still. I cannot interact with any shops and if I punch somebody, every NPC in a 30-meter radius reacts exactly the same (crouching).

In GTA, people live their daily life, come from shops, talk to each other, comments your car, takes selfies and pictures of interesting situations like car crashes, etc. In dangerous situation, some NPC fight, some run, some abandon their car and escape alleys, some steal cars and try to drive away, everything feels fresh all the time. NPCs even defend their own groups. For example, firefighters don't take kindly if you hurt one of their own.

In this video you see that NPC gets mad for his car being attacked, he attacks firefighters,s and hell breaks loose. Just look at how GOOD the animations are! Jesus this game is gold and cannot believe it is 8 years old.

You have created an astonishingly beautiful world with a level of visual detail that is pretty much unmatched.

The actual gameplay? It's fine, honestly. Plenty of RPG customization options for your character, decent weapon variety. Barring the big bugs, you can play the game how you want. hacking is fun enough, melee is fun enough, stealth is fun enough. You truly do feel free to approach things how you want to the same degree as any other game that tries to offer you these options.

Sure, there isn't much in the way of open world police pursuits, killing sprees or any of the other 'sandbox' elements that players are accustomed to with games like GTA. Quite frankly, there doesn't have to be, in my opinion.

The game will get optimized. Bugs will get fixed. The foundation of a totally unforgettable gaming experience has been laid.

You've DONE all the heavy lifting, CDPR.

54;kbebxu;Discussion;The police in this game are the most poorly designed police I’ve ever played in a video game in my life and I’m not exaggerating.;2020-12-11;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kbebxu/the_police_in_this_game_are_the_most_poorly/;"
You thought GTA police or some other game were bad where they would just show up whenever you murder somebody and know your exact position? Oh no no no. I’d even say Skyrim guards have almost better AI. Where do I even begin with cyberpunk police.

First off what triggers them? You would guess that they come after you kill enough people and then it maybe takes them like 30 seconds to roll up in cars to kill you right? No. If you kill one person, they immediately spawn in front of you out of thin air and start multiplying. The more you kill the harder it is and the game always surrounds you in cops so it’s almost impossible to survive if too many spawn. I have no words for how poorly this was designed. Oh and btw if you are aiming at civilians, cops also have the chance to spawn on you from that as well. Even if you are shooting at gang members and a civilian happens to be in your crosshairs, the cops don’t give a shit. They will go “woah buddy. You gunning down a gang? Good. AIMING AT A CIVILIAN?! THATS ILLEGAL!”

Secondly the 1-5 star cop thing is a complete joke. It only matters in terms of cop numbers not wanted level. All you have to do is drive down the street and you lose them anyways so what’s the point? Even running from them immediately loses them. They don’t even bother to chase you unless you are within 20 meters of them. They don’t even chase you in cars. In fact, I have never seen a single police officer driving a car. The most I’ve seen is them parked on the side of the road. I don’t even think enemies in the open world drive cars besides in the missions and that’s really sad. I don’t care if the driving enemy AI is so bad that they drive off road and crash into walls. At least have driving enemy AI in the game. Like come on. How can a game from like 2008 have driving enemy AI but an open world game in 2020 doesn’t? This is unacceptable.

Thirdly if you lose the cops, they immediately despawn. In other games, you would lose them and then they would still be patrolling the surrounding area maybe looking for where you went or lingering. Nope. Not in this game. The completely vanish making it very easy to steal cop cars. 

Step 1: Shoot cop

Step 2: Run

Step 3: Run back 

Step 4: Profit

Overall it’s a horrible system and is no joke the worst cop design I’ve ever seen in a game ever. Watch dogs 1, San Andreas, and literally any other game with police had better cops than this.

I shouldn’t even have to list how to fix police cause it’s blatantly obvious what it needs but if the devs even look at this, here’s a quick list:

#How to fix police in Cyberpunk2077:

•Police chase you if you try to escape and send cars after you.

•Police don’t spawn out of nowhere.

•Police patrol in cars

•Police actually chase you in cars or aircraft 

•Police only find out about the crime after a witness reports the crime and they come after you after a little bit in squad cars.

•Literally anything else that makes police, police

Rant (Edit:) To all the CDPR apologists in the comments defending this, no excuse you say can get around the fact that Cyberpunk2077 has some of the worst AI. “Oh but this is an RPG! You aren’t supposed to be chased by police. It doesn’t matter that there wasn’t much work out into it.” This isn’t a an RPG. CDPR removed it from marketing and started calling it an action adventure game. Lets raise a hypothetical that it was an RPG for a second. Genre doesn’t give a game a free pass for having little to no effort put into a part of a game. The thing that makes a game great is having freedom. If I want to go murder civilians, I should be able to without instantly dying to a cop that spawned behind me. If that freedom is too restricted, it becomes shallow and bland. Open world games are known for having freedom regardless of how you want to categorize it. Cyberpunk is far from full freedom. It tricks you with the fantasy of choice with the story and then releases you into a hollow world that you soon realize consists of nothing but lots of similar activities in a huge world with scripted opportunity.";0;13096;13096;1994;3;23

At the moment of making this post:

**PC:** 5.8/10

**PS4:** 1.8/10

**XB One:** 2.1/10

I was never expecting to see CDPR game getting ""review bombed"" - which I call players' scream of despair. 

But after seeing Digital foundry video on PS4 performance - which lets be frank is unplayable even on PS4 pro  - I can't blame console players. The game was always meant to be last gen and it should run acceptably. On PC - you also should not need 450€ GPU (if you can even find any GPU in stock) to play 1080p (native, no FidelityCAS upscaling BS, or DLSS) 60fps at ~high settings. Right now recommended GPU is a absolute bare minimum to somewhat get close to 60fps at low-medium. 

It's just so obvious bad ratings are motivated by bugs, glitches and bad optimization - in other words, rushed unfinished game.";0;2192;2192;870;2;5

This game should 100% have not been released on last-gen consoles in the state that its in. However CDPR have stated in the past that it would run ‘surprisingly well’ on the older consoles. 

https://www.altchar.com/game-news/cyberpunk-2077-performance-on-base-ps4-and-xbox-one-is-surprisingly-good-cdpr-say-ac38K7i5GsmM

This is complete bullshit, ps4 is struggling to run at 30fps in 720p. If this is supposed to be surprisingly good then it should never have released. This should have been a next-gen and pc only release rather than the current disappointment we’ve got for older consoles.

The misleading aspect of this is the marketing that was used for the older consoles.

[Cyberpunk ps4 trailer](https://youtu.be/rViiAA3qs50)

The trailer above was uploaded to the PS4 channel with Gameplay trailer - PS4 being the title.

Anyone that has played the PS4 version can clearly see that this trailer is not recorded on the PS4 or on any last-gen console.

This marketing makes the PS4 version look as good as the PC version. This is completely misleading and not representative of the PS4 version being advertised.



The next issue is the review manipulation. The reviews before release were limited to the pc version of the game, this is clearly the best version of the game by a long shot but is not representative of any console version.

The reviews as a result are completely inflated with 9/10s and do not represent the experiences of the 40% of players on consoles, this is an issue as the performance and presentation on older consoles makes the game unbearable and customers aren’t being told this in any of the reviews.


The marketing and manipulation surrounding this game needs to be called out but since it’s CDPR it barely seems to be an issue.
If this had been Ubisoft with a downgrade or EA there would be a massive outrage online but for CDPR there are defenders blaming the console or saying it’ll be fixed in a while. This needs to be addressed by the community and CDPR themselves as the future for cp2077 is very unclear for the older consoles.

Edit: alot of points are being made specifically about the performance being thanks to the console. This isn’t the main point that i wanted to make with this post. 

The false advertising and review manipulation is the main aspect that I think needs a lot more addressing than just the performance issues. I get that the ps4 is 8 years old but CDPR absolutely covered up the performance with the misleading advertising, review manipulation and ‘surprisingly good’ comments. 

I get that preorders and day one buying is risky but CDPR should absolutely be called out for hiding the state of the older console releases.

The game should never have been released on older consoles whatsoever, it is in no state to be acceptable.";0;17553;17553;2938;3;56

The story missions, the art, the animations, everything is fantastic. But an RPG this is not. This is from the perspective from someone who loves roleplaying games and feels handicapped at the moment. I'm leaving bugs and glitches out. The list is in no particular order.

**Edit:** This obviously gained more traction than I imagined and I will no longer add to it. Keep note I added many suggestions from other redditors to my initial list. Thank you for the awards. Feel free to bring it to the developers and post it elsewhere, no credits required. I don't intend to convince anyone or advocate what roleplaying means. I still think **CDPR** is one the best companies out there. Don't trade insults over a game, it's foolish. Cheers.

**Quality of Life**

\- Walk toggle for keyboard.

\- Key re-mapping for certain elements.

\- Accessibility features missing (ie: text scaling for menus).

\- In-game benchmark feature.

\- Dash should be a separate key and not a double press of walking key.

\- Crouch and skip dialogue should not share the same key.

\- The minimap is too zoomed in to be helpful in many cases.

\- Missing a toggle aim feature.

\- Ability to respec attributes. *(Note: Existing item respecs perks only)*

\- Ability to disable objective marker.

\- Ability to lower ADS sensitivity.

\- Add proper ultrawide (21:9, 32:9) support.

\- Add loot by area or/and autoloot feature.

\- Add ""stash all"" feature.

\- Add transparency option for hud elements.

\- Add way to remove mods from unequipped weapons.

\- Add toggle mouse acceleration.

\- Driving markers and onscreen trajectory (alternative GPS).

**Gameplay and immersion**

\- Body slider customization (height, weight, muscle mass).

\- Very few options for some of the character creation features (hair color, tattoos, skin complexion, scars, etc).

\- Animations for eating and drinking (excluding scripted ones).

\- Unable to remove underwear outside of inventory.

\- Vehicle customization.

\- Apartment customization.

\- Cosmetic slots or transmog feature.

\- Very few actual merchant stores in quantity and variety.

\- No garages or parking lots.

\- Crowds have low level of reactivity and awareness to the game world.

\- Very few interactive NPCs outside of missions with meaningful dialogue.

\- Very few options to meaningfully construct a personality to V. You get to choose missions endings, but not an actual persona.

\- Lack of non-action oriented stories and quests about meaningful themes of cyberpunk distopia.

\- Player cannot smoke.

\- Weapon mods and skill trees largely irrelevant outside of marginal and mostly numerical improvements to combat.

\- Lack of emergent gameplay events in the game world (ie: dynamic and random triggers).

\- Unable to alter character's appearance (barbershop, tattoo parlors, plastic surgeon).

\- Lack of character reflection outside of the few mirrors available. This furthers the disconnection between the player and the character.

\- No ownership of items (you can rob NPCs under their nose).

\- No prison or lasting crime system.

\- Wanted system is largely underdeveloped, with cops spawning out of nowhere and disappearing shortly after.

\- Cybernetics lack variety in meaningful choices that alter gameplay (except for limbs weapons). Deus Ex has far more impactful mods that actually change the way you approach combat.

\- The lifepaths are frustratingly brief and have little impact other than dialogue choices. V is essentially the same character regardless of past.

\- The traffic AI is lackluster and there are too few cars driving around for a large metropolis.

\- Trains were obviously cut, even though the whole infrastructure is visible.

\- The world interaction is quite minimal. Among items that should be interactive: chairs, benches, toilets, stools, sinks, gym equipment, light fixtures, restaurant menus, smartphones, taxi, trash bins and dumpsters, most merchant stalls, microwaves, dancing floors, gaming tables, arcades.

\- You cannot preview wardrobe and weapon purchases.

\- There is no reliable cover system.

**- Loot system overdone, invasive and distracting. You are constantly showered with redundant and marginally better items and have no attachment whatsoever with your fashion and weapon choices.** (*Dear god, I hate this one*).

\- Enemies are too spongy and level design forces frontal assault way too often.

\- Robotics and drone control largely absent (outside of scripted missions).";0;28785;28785;6046;6;275

Cyberpunk's marketing showed off a living, breathing city, with AI that seemed to behave realistically and a world that had amazing levels of immersion and interaction.

What we got was a game with a world that is very nice to look at (when not plagued with visual glitches), that far less interaction that was shown in trailers (such as no eating at food kiosks), that shoved all its amazing footage from the trailers into a 60 second montage at the start of the game, with non existent AI. These guys flat out lied about their game.

This game is not even close to being ""ready"". Not from a technical viewpoint and not from the gameplay perspective. This game needs a few months to maybe even a year at least. It's buggy and unoptimized and even worse, most gameplay aspects and features just feel like placeholders.

&#x200B;

* **""It doesn't matter if you are dead, as long as you are doing it in style""**

Seriously? How tone deaf are the people in their marketing department?! There is absolutely no emphasis on fashion and style at all, the lack of a transmog system results in your character looking like a freaking clown most of the time. There is almost no customization to be found in this game for being an open world game, you can't even CHANGE YOUR FREAKING HAIRSTYLE. 

&#x200B;

* **""Each NPC has their own handcrafted routine""**

I'm even hesitant to call the NPC behavior AI, since stupidly walking from point A to B with the fluidity of a lego stopmotion figure, only to vanish and respawn a few meters away has nothing to do with ""intelligence"" or a ""handcrafted routine"". There is no reaction to anything you do, everything feels static and unrealisitic. 

&#x200B;

* **""The game runs surprisingly well on last gen consoles""**

I don't know what you need to smoke in order to perceive the state of the game on PS4/XboxOne as ""surprisingly well running"". At this point I'm wondering if CDPR has been developing an entirely different game for the last few years.

&#x200B;

* **""We've crafted every vehicle with immense detail""**

I don't give a crap about the number of polygons of my car interior, when the driving in this game is absolutely horrendous. The controls are floaty and unresponsive, the minimap doesn't even zoom out when driving, there isn't even a single freaking parking lot. Oh and don't even get me started about the car AI. Or, better said, the lack thereof.

&#x200B;

* **""Braindance is a pretty big part of the Cyberpunk universe""**

Heralded as this big new shiny thing, Braindance is absolutely nowhere to be seen outside of scripted mission in this game. I honestly couldn't believe it when people claimed that you can even buy BD's but there's no way to experience them as side content. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but again, this is HUGELY overselling things on CDPRs part.

&#x200B;

I could go on and on, believe me, there is enough deceptive and overhyped marketing material out there, waiting to be torn apart by disappointed fans who made the age-old mistake of getting excited based on cherry picked material and purposefully misleading marketing lingo. I tried to not get as hyped, so as not to develop unrealistic expectations, but what CD Projekt Red delivered is not even worthy of reasonable expectations. Sure, the game looks fantastic (if you can get it to run), the story seems promising so far and the main characters have some of the best animated and textured faces I've seen in some time, but man...so many aspects of this game are undercooked, oversold and overhyped and CDPR are definitely to blame here (not exclusively though). I've uninstalled the game already, if they won't delay it to the point where it's finished, I have to do it myself.";0;8654;8654;1896;3;20

""We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community systems to create the most believable city in any open-world game to date""

""The city streets are bustling with crowds of people from all facets of life, all living their lives, with a full day/night cycle.""

(Source: https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0?t=773)

""According to new CDPR interviews, Cyberpunk 2077's new real-time AI systems will allow for incredible dynamism. Thousands of NPCs will have actual daily routines throughout Night City's six districts, including a ton of robust and varied characters with cyborg implants, unique designs and animations, and day and night cycles.""

(Source: https://www.tweaktown.com/news/73048/over-thousand-cyberpunk-2077-npcs-will-have-unique-daily-routines/index.html)

**Now let's compare these statements to what is in the game at launch:**

* No NPC Day/Night cycle. NPCs spawn and despawn outside of the player's view. 

* If an NPC is doing an action, they will do that action forever until the player moves.

* NPCs that are not story/side quest related have one dialog reply.

* If one NPC is assaulted, every other NPC in a large circle around the player will crouch to the floor in the same animation, even if they did not see the original assault.

* NPCs in a car will follow a specific route. If the route is even slightly interupted, for example by your car, they will cease to move forever until you remove the obstruction.

* NPCs in a car will not attempt to move or exit their vehicle if you assault them with bullets/another vehicle.

* NPCs will not acknowledge the player if they run the player over with their car.

* NPCs will not attempt to steal their vehicle back if you steal it from them.

* NPCs will not attack you or defend themselves in any way or form, even if engaged upon with just fists.

* Police spawn around the player's vision when the player is wanted, forever, until they attempt to hide or drive away.

* Police to not attempt to question, warn, or arrest the player for even the smallest crime commited, for example if you bump into them or accidently enter a private area.

* Police are incapable of driving cars and chasing the player if they drive away.

* Police will not attack hostile targets like Gangs if they are not already doing so in an activity.

* Police will know if the player has attacked an NPC in the middle of the badlands and spawn next to the player, without vehicles.

* NPCs will rarely thank or acknowledge the player if they are helped by the player.

* Scripted NPCs that have dialog will say their dialog then proceed to stand there forever. They will also repeat the same dialog if the player leaves the area and visits again later.

803;kccabx;Meta;"🐦 Hey CD Projekt Red, I think you shipped the wrong config on PC. Here's a guide that shows you how to ""unlock"" Cyberpunk for possibly massive performance improvements.";2020-12-13;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kccabx/hey_cd_projekt_red_i_think_you_shipped_the_wrong/;">> Update regarding the 1.05 patchnotes saying this file appearantly does nothing:

Hey all, I had no intention to jebait anybody in any way. I even asked two friends to try this fix before posting it, because it seemed unreal to me a file like this could change ANYTHING. After they confirmed this, I went to post it on reddit and people's responses were huge. I expected this to ONLY *maybe* help in niche-cases. Only after hundreds of people allegedly confirming that it made noticable diffferences, stability being the most common, reflecting purposefully increased memory pools, I started to collect data and tried to draw a better picture since some characteristics seemed very distinct (for example new Ryzens seeming to be totally unaffected). Maybe I got hit with placebo, but how the hell is it possible thousands of people appearantly did too? This bugs me quite a bit.
If I really spread misinformation, I am sincerely apologizing. Obviously it's hard to argue with patchnotes most likely backed by developers or a member of QA, but for me my personal changes were far beyond any deviation that would fall in within placebo limits. (Yes, I am very aware that a game restart can fix a common memory leak issue or can get the game the chance to reorder itself, therefore giving you a few perceived temporary extra fps gains) I am still positive my game ran way more stable (even on higher settings and better resolution) and it recovered a lot better from fps drops. A prominent point were definite improvements in load times. I am not trying to pull something out of thin air for the sake of defending myself, I am being honest. 

To the people calling me out for allegedly farming awards or having ill intentions: If there is any way I can refund the awards, for example via staff, I will do so asap. If I can refund Platinum / Gold 1:1 I will immediately do that if I am asked for a refund.  I have zero interest in keeping any undeserved rewards. The one person who actually has donated me 4.69$ via PayPal has already been promptly refunded after reading the 1.05 patchnotes. -->  https://i.imgur.com/DY6q0LR.png

I only had good intentions, sharing around what I found to get back feedback on, waiting for people to either tell me this is only in my head and that I am a muppet or responses confirming my assumptions. And I got a **lot** more from the later. 

I would appreciate it if a CDPR dev can reach out to me personally so I have first hand confirmation, but It's definitely hard to argue with an official set of patchnotes claiming this file does nothing.

Again, sincere apologies if I indeed sold you the biggest snake oil barrel in 2020 on accident. It's just hard to grasp for me atm that this thread has tons of posts backing up my assumptions while an official statement states the complete opposite.

# Pre-Story 🐒

Hi, I played Cyberpunk for 14 hours now and was quite bummed from the start.

I have the following rig:

* CPU: i7 4790K @ 4.4GHz
* GPU: EVGA 1080Ti
* RAM: 32GB DDR3
* Game on SSD, Windows on a seperate SSD

My rig is normally a ~~monster~~ trusty chap when it comes to performance, I can play the most recent titles on 1440p high on at LEAST 60 fps.

&#x200B;

I was shocked that I was only averaging **30 - 50fps** (**low**est settings possible,**1080p**, 70fov, no extra jazz) at best depending on the amount of objects I was looking at. For someone that is used to play at 1440p @ 144hz, this was heart-wrenchingly bad performance and half an agony to play. So I took a look at CyberPunk in Process Lasso and noticed that both my CPU and GPU always lounge around at 40 - 60% and that my GPU consumed a humble 100 Watts. Something felt horribly off. It makes ZERO sense that my cpu & gpu barely do anything but at the same time my performance is horse shit.

I was looking on advice on /r/pcmasterrace, people with similar or worse rigs than mine were shocked how I was basically at the ~~bottom's barrel~~ bottom of the barrel, while they had no issues to play at 1080p @ high or 1440p @ medium. What the heck is going on?

&#x200B;

# Guide 💡

Since I am a C# developer and very comfortable around configuration files, I figured it wouldn't hurt to take a look at the configuration files. And found something that I didn't believe.

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/aOObDhn.png](https://i.imgur.com/aOObDhn.png)

&#x200B;

Please take a look at the above picture. This picture shows the configuration columns for each platform. PC, Durango, Orbis. (Durango & Orbis is what XBox & PlayStation run on).

Now take a look at **PoolCPU** and **PoolGPU**. These values are the same as the other platforms. This looks off. So I decided to give it a try and just screw around with this config. So based off my rig I assigned some values that made a little more sense to me.

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/xTnf0VX.png](https://i.imgur.com/xTnf0VX.png)

&#x200B;

I assigned 16GB (of RAM I guess) to my CPU and 11GB of my GPU's VRAM.

And howdy cowboy, my i7 finally woke the fuck up and started kicking in second gear, now working at 85 - 95% CPU usage. My 1080Ti also now uses 230 Watts on avg instead of a sad 100W.

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/fP32eka.png](https://i.imgur.com/fP32eka.png)

&#x200B;

Booted the game and et voila, I am now rocking a solid 60+ fps on:

* High Settings
* No Film Grain, No Ambient Occlusion, Lens Flare etc.
* 80 Fov
* 1440p

&#x200B;

My loading times have gone down from 20 seconds to 2.

&#x200B;

>**I can't put the emotion in words how I felt when I discovered this. It was something between disbelief, immense joy and confusion.**

I can confirm GOG patch 1.04 and Steam patch 1.04 have this borked configuration file.

If you need guidance on what to assign in your config:

* PoolCPU: Use half of what your RAM is, make sure to leave 4GB for windows tho.
* PoolGPU: Google your graphics card on google and see how much VRAM it has. For example my EVGA 1080Ti has **11 GB GDDR5X, so I am entering 11GB.**

# A fair bit of warning 💀

* These changes can possibly crash your CyberPunk and Windows. I do not take any responsibility for any problems resulting from this.
* CyberPunk will complain that it crashed, even when you close it. This shouldn't matter too much though.
* Mileage may vary. I can't guarantee this will massively improve your performance, I can only say mine did a huge leap and the response from my friends has been very positive.

&#x200B;

If anybody is more familiar with the configuration I am touching, please let me know and I will adjust it. I am merely showing this around because it looks like a promising starting point for many who have weird performance issues.

&#x200B;

*If this helped you, please let us know with a short comment how much your FPS and joystick ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) went up.*

A lot more depth than the Twitter post for sure. Here is the full recording, and I summarized some key highlights below:

https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/conference-call-with-the-board_14-12-2020.mp3

The main theme was CDPR’s leadership taking the blame for pushing on releasing too soon, underestimating performance issues on last gen consoles. They take a position as if the only issue is the technical performance on PS4/Xbox One - which is very disappointing.

At 32:50 there finally is a question about the player feedback around the game’s features vs expectations - moving away from focusing on console bugs and low performance. But the team does not address this outright beyond saying the sales are great, and do not acknowledge underdelivery vs what was promised.

As mentioned in the Tweet, there will be an initial update in 7 days - to be followed by January and February releases. However, based on this call, it seems unlikely that there will be major updates to things like AI, interactiveness, open world features etc. In passing, very briefly, they mention that they see things like AI and NPC issues as “bugs”, but it remains to be seen to what extent this is actually addressed in the upcoming fixes and patches.

CDPR will announce sales figures before Christmas, but they mention they will likely not reveal the number of refunds claimed following today’s offer to gamers.

An interesting question was asked around the actual PC playing stats (playtime, stickiness etc). The team mentions that feedback from players that spend more time with the game is much better, especially PC gamers. They did not reveal stats around average playtime, player return, etc.

Pre-order breakdown by platform was requested, provided as: PC 59%, consoles 41%. CDPR says they have no direct visibility of split between next and last gen.

80;kcsm11;Discussion;47 Hours in on PC, This is not an RPG.;2020-12-14;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kcsm11/47_hours_in_on_pc_this_is_not_an_rpg/;"This game is an on rails open-world, action-adventure game with mechanics and an open world grind akin to Ubisoft games.

I say this to say, I will not be requesting a refund. As I still want to support the ""Cyberpunk Genre""

Honestly, I just wanted to warn anyone that is expecting an RPG the likes of ""Skyrim"" or ""New Vegas"" that this is not that game... It really is disappointing, I don't have anyone else to blame but myself for falling into the marketing hype of the trailers.

As a on-rails single player game, the story was top notch, but it was no RPG.

I started following this game back in 2013, It was around the time New Vegas, Skyrim and Deus Ex were relatively still fresh, I had finished them and done a second play through and was looking for a new RPG. That's when I came across the first trailer for Cyberpunk, obviously the mind wanders into what amazing ""rpgness/fun"" this game could produce. I stopped watching trailers after the E3 trailer launch and also actively stopped looking at development for the game, because I didn't want to spoil the story/game play, I wanted a fresh experience, just like I had with those previous games.

ahhh, why am I even typing this... I'll be attacked from several different angles from dedicated fans.

I guess, I'm just upset that I didn't receive any immersion from this game passed the prologue, and I was waiting for those juicy world changing RPG moments that unfortunately never came.

To the devs: The story and the environment were phenomenal and you guys did an amazing job. I hope in future updates you expand the games RPG elements and make this truly a contender with the best, because the genre has that ability.

If you got to the end, thanks :)

Kind Regards

Alex

== Edit ==

Fixed spelling mistakes and formatting

== Final Thoughts ==

I wanted to thank everyone for participating in an adult discussion about the RPG element of the game, My view has not changed about the status of the game as an RPG, I have listened and also participated at times different debates.

I hope that the devs from cyberpunk or other studio's read this and take it as constructive criticism, because in the end we all want them to win and provide a better product.

To the people who private messaged me and said they were scared to write a post like this on reddit for the backlash, I would say, if your genuine with your thoughts, people will resonate with them and you may have a chance at change. But don't be deterred.

One again

78;kd2ujb;Discussion;The amount of poor shaming for users playing on PS4&XB1 is disgusting;2020-12-14;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kd2ujb/the_amount_of_poor_shaming_for_users_playing_on/;"I will first preface this by saying I am a PC player that has built my PC part by part and not all at once. Now to my point, a lot of users around reddit (not really this sub thankfully) and a SHIT TON of people on twitter are saying stuff like ""Imagine expecting a game to run well on a seven year old system"", ""Bro, just build a PC bro"" or users posting gifs of people saying ""Everybody hide yo money, it smells like poor 'round here"". Fucking despicable

We are in a middle of a very serious pandemic, where we have 200,000 deaths here in the US alone, millions of layoffs, myself included, and short supply of GPU's and consoles due to scalpers, even for people that have enough to pay MSRP.

I think the memes about it running on consoles is perfectly ok and quite funny at times mainly due to it being directed towards CDPR. It should never be the fault of the customer that a game originally announced for last gen (XB1&PS4 in 2018 E3) to expect it to run well with minimal crashes, with a $60 price tag. Even fucking CDPR acknowledges this.

Stop being elitist, Stop poor shaming. Being poor could happen to anybody within days being out of their control, like me. I'm very grateful I got my computer built when I did before I was laid off, even if it is low end.

Sorry for the rant though, just had to get it off my chest and needed an outlet

EDIT: Would like to add that this is more of an ""Underprivileged shaming"" scenario than anything else. Some people have the money for a new console but simply can't get one, unless they'd like to fork over 2 grand.

EDIT 2: most of the people that are poor shaming, you can find on twitter on replies to any of CDPRs tweets. Not much to find on reddit. Some of you are being pretty toxic right now :( 

EDIT 3: Lol I was not calling anyone with the last gen poor sorry if I came off that way

840;kdajjy;Meta;40 hours in and my only takeaway is that this is the best marketing campaign for GTA VI that Rockstar could've ever asked for.;2020-12-14;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdajjy/40_hours_in_and_my_only_takeaway_is_that_this_is/;"Whether you're a fan of Rockstar or not - they set the bar for Open World games in 2013 and raised it even higher in 2018. Games from other devs like **Ubisoft (Watch Dogs, AC), Deep Silver (Saint's Row), Ryu Ga Toku Studios (Yakuza)** and even fucking **Square Enix threw their hat in the ring of Open World games with Sleeping Dogs** \- all these devs stepped up to the plate and have delivered some of the most memorable Open World games to date. Hell, I'm still holding out hope for a Sleeping Dogs 2, personally.

The way an Open World game reacts to your actions in game is one of the biggest parts of being an Open World game. Random citizens fleeing from you when you pull out your gun, or even ballsy randos who fight back when you try to steal their car, or just being chased a couple of blocks by cops you have to out maneuver in some alleyways. Hell, cops in GTA IV *actually arrested* other npcs if they saw an npc attacked you first. AI is a huge fucking part about Open World games. 

**Immersion. Suspension of disbelief. Cyberpunk doesn't even have a fraction of that shit.**

And that's just the ***bare minimum*** for what's expected in an Open World game.

The NPC AI in Cyberpunk 2077 is just **utterly inexcusable.**

Shoot a gun in the air and all the npcs get out of their cars and cower right next to their doors. Even if you put your gun away and run away they don't get back into their cars - they just despawn as if they got snapped away by the Infinity Gauntlet. **If you park your vehicle in the road, drivers won't even attempt to drive around it - they will sit there and wait for the vehicle in question to move so they can go back on their merry railroad ride.** 

Cyberpunk is (supposed to be) set in a gritty, dark world where people would sell their organs to get a leg up and you're telling me there's not a single impatient driver? No one with roadrage at all? Not one person is not a fucking hurry to get somewhere in Night City? Not ONE?

How the fuck did small things like this make it past the dev team?

Cops spawn on you no matter where you fucking are - even if you killed some random asshole in the middle of the Badlands. We're not talking vehicles showing up and NPCs running out of them - just straight up appear out of ***thin fucking air.*** **In a fucking universe where the Police actually have access to flying armored AVs that can go anywhere - CDPR opted to make cops just spawn out of thin air. It's fucking baffling.** 

**When games like GTA Vice City from the fucking PS2 era have a more competent police chase system I feel like people have to call it out. More reviewers need(ed) to call it out.**

I don't even know if NPC AI is something they can fix at this point. Nor do I know if I'd even care if they announced it in a patch 6 months from now. **And that's just the Open World ""half"" of this game. Don't get me started on how this is as far from an RPG as Neptune is to the Sun.** 

The worst part of it all is that these were all gameplay design choices - not bugs. A bug is when your character goes flying off a cliff because of the time slow interacting with the physics or when your character's dick clips through his pants or the game just imploding because of framerate issues - **those are bugs.** Having police show up out of thin air and NPCs not having any semblance of realism to them is a **design choice.**

After putting 40 hours into the game, beating the Streetkid and Corpo storylines (spoilers, all 3 paths end on the same fucking rail so I'm sorry if I'm not eager to jump into Nomad), I can safely say that **even if this game ran wonderfully on every system/console at launch this game is not worth the hype that was shoved down our throats for the past 7 years.** It's a subpar GTA clone at it's worst, a really disappointing ""RPG"" at best.

Anyone telling you this is a next-gen, genre defining game that will raise the bar is lying to you. ***Flat out.***

At the risk of sounding like an utter R\* fanboy, **CDPR better pray to the powers that be that GTA VI (or any future Open World game for that matter) isn't going to be in a futuristic/cyberpunk setting because they will shit all over this without even trying.**";0;1322;1322;350;0;4

Do not expect a miracle, if CDPR decided to invest resources into improving the game beyond basic optimization/bug fixes at all.

We all know the game is disappointing technically.  Even the fanboys are frustrated, but just won't openly critique the game.  I see a lot of people saying the issues with this game will be ""patched out.""  While it is possible for some aspects of the game to be rectified in maintenance patches, other core elements of the game require complete overhauls or creation in the first place.  Such overhauls demand significant time and resources to develop and implement.

**Here's a list of some things that standard patches can address:**

* Glitches (e.g. T-posing NPCs, quest bugs, floating cigarettes, missing items in hands, etc.)
* Optimization (e.g. FPS improvements, graphical improvements, etc.)
* Minor tweaks (e.g. game economy, render distance, size of the minimap, making the closet a container like the stash, etc.)
* CTD issues

**Here's a list of things that likely require full overhauls that would be equivalent to a major title update a la** ***The Division*** **or** ***No Man's Sky*** **due to poor implementation (or lack thereof):**

* Pedestrian AI (e.g. day/night cycles, interactivity, reactions to danger, introduction of petty crime like theft, etc.)
* Police AI (e.g. trigger based on witnesses/lore-based presence, arrival, pursuit, bounties, MaxTac, etc.)
* Vehicular AI (e.g. basic stimuli response, adaptation/improvisation, etc.)
* Combat AI (e.g. stealth/breaking contact, coordination, etc.)
* Dynamic events (e.g. car accidents triggering Trauma Team, police responding to calls, etc.)
* Radiant quests (e.g. respawning NCPD dispatches, basic gigs, etc.)
* Procedural rendering/memory loss (e.g. citizens/cars changing or despawning when out of view)
* Post-creation character customization (e.g. tattoos, haircuts, genitals, etc.)
* Clothing/gear customization (i.e. overhaul to the clothing system)
* Weapon damage/rarity overhaul (e.g. lore-based damage/value/rarity depending on manufacturer, departing from MMO gaming industry standard loot rarity/damage system)

**Here's a list of actual quest/story DLC that is likely planned or should be restored:**

* Life paths (e.g. restoring obviously cut content, introducing post-game life path stories, etc.)
* Factions (e.g. introducing faction AI, questlines diving into competing factions, etc.)
* Real estate (e.g. developing new apartments, questlines to earn, economy tweaks, etc.)
* Story DLC (e.g. full-on expansions of the game)

If I had to guess, I would say fixing/implementing the above *basic* features that were cut, poorly implemented, or never even considered would take at least 18 months of dedicated development.  That's on top of any planned quest/story DLC.  If I were CDPR (looking at my stock prices), I would make the solid business decision of not announcing any story DLC, postponing it without an announcement, and work on fixing as much of these core gameplay elements as is feasible before launching an expansion like a year or more from now.

Each of the bullet points I've included in the middle list can have their own entire posts devoted to them (in fact, each of them have at least a dozen posts on this subreddit).  I've just heavily TL;DR'ed the issues raised in those posts.

Edit: Thanks for all the awards!  I take it from the 91% upvoted rating that much of the community agrees with this.  I think we all know that certain aspects of the game are amazing, but we shouldn't allow those nuggets of excellence be an excuse for the lackluster parts we all know exist.";0;17805;17805;2162;1;91

I'm a member of the ""CP77 Modding Tools"" Discord and wanted to give y'all an update and status regarding modding for the game.

Cyberpunk has been released 4 days ago, and we the community have been working day and night on reverse engineering the engine. With every day, we are getting closer to release the first mod manager and to be able to load mods without changing the files directly. The discord is currently with a lot of members who have created ""WolvenKit"", the modding kit for W3 and CDPR staff who are watching us. We all are working together to create tools and mods for everyone.

**Modding status:**  
The current status of a mod manager is unclear, but not far away. Thanks to Avery3R to figuring out a way to use the already build in console, we have managed to archive a huge milestone. While working on a mod manager we are also working of various tool to help modders. A huge part we are working on are getting all those hashes for game files and working on textures and model extraction.

&#x200B;

**Updates:**  
If you want, you can follow all progress live on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Epkq79kd96) or wait for a new post from me or other members, as well as help us working on tools.

&#x200B;

Until then, have fun and a good day in Cyberpunk2077!  


PS: Feel free to ask any questions regarding modding. I'll try my best answering everything as good as i can or join the discord and ask the modders yourself!";0;2412;2412;478;0;5

**Features we were told to expect but aren't in the game:**

\- AMAZING AI that directs enemies during combat/patrol but also citizens and npcs' daily life ([https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kbk4ap/the\_ai\_of\_cyberpunk\_2077\_an\_indepth\_look\_at\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kbk4ap/the_ai_of_cyberpunk_2077_an_indepth_look_at_the/))

\- wanted system and corrupt police ([https://gamerant.com/cyberpunk-2077-wanted-system-corrupt-police/](https://gamerant.com/cyberpunk-2077-wanted-system-corrupt-police/))

\-Immersive police involvment changing with the area where you commited the crime ([https://www.usgamer.net/articles/cyberpunk-2077-producer-details-law-enforcement](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/cyberpunk-2077-producer-details-law-enforcement))

\- (half kept) in general, more interesting combat and hacking ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FknHjl7eQ6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FknHjl7eQ6o)). Some examples are the ability to use your wire to hack people ([https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0?t=2540](https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0?t=2540)), hacking reveales information about the network, more interesting viruses to upload, more loot from hacked devices. DISCLAIMER: the changes here may be due entirely to balace issues and/or making the game better and more intuitive. I keep this as a promise ""half kept"" as the hacking system gets really boring really soon and doesn't even many abilities you can upgrade. The skill tree is filled with passive and all you do is press tab, pick whatever, kill, repeat. For a better explanation please read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kcve8s/promised\_but\_missing\_feature\_list\_will\_update/gfyly34?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kcve8s/promised_but_missing_feature_list_will_update/gfyly34?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

\- more interesting gameplay, for example: trauma team that plays a key role, freequent flying avs, ads that target the player point to the merchant that sells that product, merch could be pre-viewed before purchase (Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVAryZ0GLwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVAryZ0GLwE) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjF9GgrY9c0&feature=youtu.be&t=2531](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjF9GgrY9c0&feature=youtu.be&t=2531)) NOTE: this section is by far the most oversimplied one. There are a number of minute key things I am not stating in this thread because I don't want to dilute it too much, i.e.: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kcve8s/promised\_but\_missing\_feature\_list\_will\_update/gfvxkxw?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kcve8s/promised_but_missing_feature_list_will_update/gfvxkxw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

\- Strong RPG elements ([https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-much-deeper-roleplaying-experience-than-the-witcher-3-says-dev/](https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-much-deeper-roleplaying-experience-than-the-witcher-3-says-dev/)). This was actually subject of lengthy debates in this thread, as some of you are happy with the ""RPGness"" of CP2077. Personally I have not seen a lot of elements that make a game an RPG, such as relevant checks (speech, perception... right now all we have are options to break a door or go around it), solid companions, defined power dynamics between factions and a general sense of progression achieved through meaningful upgrade to your character. The game right now is more akin to a shooter/looter with stats. Which is not ""strong RPG element"". Mind you, if you like it this way it's perfect, and I personally don't mind it too much. But the lack of RPG components does stay in the list as a promised not fulfilled. And no, madqueen, having 7 different finales that you get to choose doesn't make a looter/shooter an RPG.

\- NPC unique daily routine and AI ([https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/08/cyberpunk-2077-npcs-1000-daily-routines/](https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/08/cyberpunk-2077-npcs-1000-daily-routines/))

\- Quest decisions will have relevance in the world ([https://onlysp.escapistmagazine.com/cyberpunk-2077-changes/](https://onlysp.escapistmagazine.com/cyberpunk-2077-changes/))

\- (half kept) Meaningful day and night cycle (right now it's mainly cosmetic and doesn't impact the gameplay a lot, e.g.: you aren't more stealthy at night) as described in [Exploring Cyberpunk's Night City with CD Projekt Red - Cyberpunk 2077 - Gamereactor](https://www.gamereactor.eu/exploring-cyberpunks-night-city-with-cd-projekt-red/) but it does something, like opening and closing some venues (according to some, I am 200h in and venues are always open for me) and modifying some population density. I have not seen evidence of places being more dangerous at night. If you have please record a clip and send it over.

\- Incredible character customization during creation / in-game ([https://gamecrate.com/cyberpunk-2077-boxing-power-weapons-militech-spider-robot-and-more/23426](https://gamecrate.com/cyberpunk-2077-boxing-power-weapons-militech-spider-robot-and-more/23426) and [https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/cyberpunk-2077-character-creation/](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/cyberpunk-2077-character-creation/))

\- Use of drones for more than just some missions in the game ([https://gamecrate.com/cyberpunk-2077-boxing-power-weapons-militech-spider-robot-and-more/23426](https://gamecrate.com/cyberpunk-2077-boxing-power-weapons-militech-spider-robot-and-more/23426))

\- three different lifepaths and more that would actually have more impact than what we are getting now ([Wall running and metro system are not the biggest thing to be cut out from the game.

\- The game will let you select your body type and your gender freely, allowing you to obtain whatever combination of voice/gender/genitalia you want.

IMPORTANT: I see many of you contributed and I thank you. However this thread is specifically for broken promises, i.e. things that they said (in an article, tweet, interview...) we would find in the game and didn't. I believe there are other thread specifically for quality of life things we would want to see implemented in the game (and the list is infinite there as well).

EDIT: Alright I have monitored all your replies and added what I felt was truthful. The point of this list is not to discuss minutia but to have a concentrated and dense point of reference for future discussion.

My personal opinion is that Cyberpunk 2077 is another reason to always try to hold people accountable for what they promised. Yes I know what companies do isn't illegal but that should not stop us to manifest discontent for what we think are malpractices in the game industry.

Edit: thank you for the awards - I really appreciate it. However please do not waste your money on me, I am lucky enough. Donate instead to an organization of your choice, my favorite ones are Emergency (of Gino Strada) or Wikipedia.";0;11654;11654;2176;8;104

I messed around with them a bit and found out there is actually vehicle combat outside of scripted chases.

RDR2 had also bit harsh early weeks when it was released on PC, but the game was extremely demanding and the content was very appealing. People knew its potential from the console release and R* patched the game eventually to make it more stable. I've played CP2077 for around 40 hours and I actually enjoy it so much, it is like an experience I've never felt, since the World is very good, graphics are insane and but the gameplay is the fact that very very linear where we mostly just run into side quest or events like the last Assassin's Creed games. I must say I am not even bored while doing them, but I wish there was more making us feel it like it was a simulation in this World, being able to interact with the World so we could feel the immersion better.

Like the all other redditors keep reminding we were promised to have new apartments, vehicle customization or many other features, the game seriously needs more interaction with the World. I hope not to see that multiplayer mode at least for a year.

I cannot thank enough for the awards. I wish I could also discuss you in this post, but due to my deadline of assigments not able to now. I really love this sub a lot and respect to everyone's opinions. People are really bringing quite quality topics into light, telling their constructive feedbacks for all the time. In the end, I know CDPR is going to fix their game eventually. Ubisoft had been releasing broken games for years, yet instead they care about their reputation and hell CDPR is going to give their best for their new baby.

Most games start with a honeymoon and after a while people start seeing negative sides of it. For CP2077, it is going to be vice versa and the more time passed we will start seeing the other sides of the game. For now, people have every single right to complain about all those missing features, optimization of the game and more. We were happy to know this game was going to be DRM-Free, so it would perform a lot better.

This game isn’t what it was supposed to be. It was supposed to be the greatest game of all time and it didn’t live up to those impossible expectations because when you hype something up for 7 years you’re going to be disappointed no matter what.
I’m aware of everything bad that’s being said about it and I agree, I just don’t care. For me, the good outweighs the bad by far. I compare it to Outer Worlds because I feel like that’s the closest related game I’ve played. It’s like OW but with way better combat, story, map, everything. The missions are so well thought out, even the small ones, that I find myself wanting to 100% the game which I usually never do. The combat with guns is ok, but the sword combat is the best I’ve ever played. I couldn’t care less about the driving because I either run or fast travel anyway. It’s not a racing game or GTA, it’s an RPG in a packed city. I don’t think it’s right for them to have ignored older consoles and I’m not going to defend that, but with a new game like this of course you’re going to need better equipment to have a smooth experience. I’ve been using a Series S and it crashed only twice on me in the 40 hours I’ve played so far and no glitches were bad enough to disrupt my game. 
I just felt like I needed to put some positivity on this subreddit as people seem to be so caught up on it not being impossibly perfect and are ignoring how great of a game it is because it didn’t meet impossible expectations. I’m going to leave this subreddit and play this game for a couple hundred hours and enjoy every second. I hope when I check back someday people will have calmed down and enjoyed the game for what it is.";0;5973;5973;1593;0;71
61;kdp3mo;Discussion;For 7+ years of development, Cyberpunk 2077 has an alarming number of poor design choices (somewhat long);2020-12-15;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdp3mo/for_7_years_of_development_cyberpunk_2077_has_an/;"With 7 years under this game's belt, I would expect to see certain things that have become staples in RPGs (yes...I know this game is arguably an RPG). And for all the hype and a $60 price tag, these things should have been included, but weren't.

&#x200B;

* Better driving AI. It's atrocious. [I took this video yesterday of AI driving THROUGH highway barriers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wTNtygvl_c&t)

&#x200B;

* Better driving controls for certain platforms (namely PC). The mouse should be able to be used as a steering wheel, and not solely the camera. I'm either flooring the gas or not touching it, and either turning the steering wheel hard over or leaving it center. Who drives like this?

&#x200B;

* Better law enforcement AI. Stand next to them for longer than 3 seconds? They shoot you. Cross the yellow tape? You get shot. Shoot someone from a 100 story building roof? They immediately spawn behind you and start shooting you. They don't chase you, and there is no ""star"" system like GTA has. You're either wanted dead, or you're a model A citizen. But that can change in 3 seconds.

&#x200B;

* No ""barbershop"", or any way to change your character's look post-creation. Why? All that work was put into the creator, but you're stuck with your look forever? World of Warcraft does this. GTA does this. But Cyberpunk 2077, the most hyped game of 2020, can't do this?

&#x200B;

* No car customization. I ask the same questions I did about the lack of a barbershop.

&#x200B;

* The crafting/upgrade system is poorly thought out. Upgrading blue or higher tier items just isn't worth it. The required materials are too rare just to get an extra 3-5 armor, when you can just wait a level or two and get a white item that has a 10 armor or better increase. Crafting my own items is also trivial considering how numerous loot is in the world, and how easy it is to make money and just buy better stuff from a vendor.

&#x200B;

* No way to see what level requirement upgrading gear has. All I get is a message telling me my level is too low to upgrade an item, but I'm not told what the new level requirement is. Why the secrecy?

&#x200B;

* Certain attachments, like scopes, don't say what weapons or items they can be slotted into. It's a guessing game, and when trying to clean my inventory of the dozens of scopes I've accumulated I'm afraid of tossing anything for fear of throwing out the one scope a certain gun could have used. *We need better information on our inventory items*.

&#x200B;

* No control over my mobile phone. If someone calls me, I have no option to refuse the call. I will always take the call, *even if I'm already talking to someone in a conversation*. Wow. Bad design! I can't understand either conversation because someone is talking in world and someone is talking over my phone.

&#x200B;

* The higher tier arm cybermods (i.e. Gorilla Arms, Mantis Blades, Projectile System, Monowire) are not balanced against themselves or existing weapons that are similar in game. For example, by the time I had amassed the required $15,000 euros and 20 street cred to buy Mantis Blades, I had already found a katana that was over 200 extra DPS. What good were Mantis Blades then? They weren't, and I was forced to ditch them. The projectile system essentially gives you a grenade launcher in your arm with *unlimited ammo,* effectively making my explosive grenades redundant.

&#x200B;

* Absolutely no way to reset your attributes, and no easy way to reset your perks. The only way to reset perks is by using an item that costs $100,000 euros, and whatever attributes you choose you're stuck with forever. This is a single player game. There is NO reason I shouldn't be allowed to sculpt and craft my character any way I see fit over the course of the WHOLE game, and not just at character creation or during the times I'm allotted skill points. Even multiplayer games like World of Warcraft allow you to freely swap around your builds and points to try various things.

&#x200B;

For a game originally branded as an RPG, it has a surprising number of restrictions and barriers that prevents the player from actually playing how they want, and mold their character into what they want at any point during the game's story.

The voice acting, story sequences, and cinematics are nice and immersive, but that doesn't make up for the shortfalls of everything else that's sorely lacking in various areas.

I really, really hope that once the immediate major bugs are fixed, performance is addressed across all platforms, and the game gets to a stable base that can built upon, we start to see many (hopefully all) of these poor design decisions addressed and resolved so Cyberpunk 2077 can live up to the hype the publisher and developers catapulted it with.";0;7099;7099;1945;1;21
392;kdjkx9;Love;Finished the game 100%, twice.,;2020-12-15;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdjkx9/finished_the_game_100_twice/;"It's okay. Nothing special, nothing what they promised. 

The replay ability is literally 0. Outside of a couple of different sentences trough the game, it's the same story to play 3 times. I managed to finish it twice, couldn't do it the third time.

Did all the side-quests, even the secret ones. I think 10 of them were memorable, the rest was all the same. Either go somewhere and pick something up then shoot enemies, or go somewhere to shoot enemies. 

Armor is fine, the more you invest in tech skills/engi, the more you get out of it. I played both times on hard because after a while you literally become an unkillable god.

The weapons need a lot of tweaking. If you get a revolver with a headshot multiplier you can literally one shot everything by level 20. Im talking 1 crit shot = about 1 million damage, literally, at level 30 if you pick the crit skills which is a major overkill.

The cars look great but feel like shit on M&K.  On controller they are realistic and fun to drive, they took the Forza Approach with the cars mixed with some arcade feeling. It's good.

Didn't pay much attention to the AI or anything as it's basically non existent outside of scripted scenes during quests or the story. It's a shame, but what can you do.

The only thing they delivered on completely was the looks of this game. The art team knocked it out of the park, and whoever designed the city, graphics, effects. Looks really really good. I  wouldn't call it next gen good, or era defining good, but it looks really good none the less.

Pretty sure I won't touch this game until the DLCs come out, and unless they plan to turn this into an actual open world game, will probably not touch it after the DLCs. There is nothing to do now that the story and quests are over, no reason to tweak your build, no incentive to push forward other than to cruise Night City and look at how beautiful the scenes are.

And no, im not complaining that i have nothing to do now that i did everything, just stating the fact that for such a long development cycle it is incredibly short and empty. The only reason I kept pushing to 100% was to see if something might come up different, but it didn't.

Currently, media & memes are only allowed on Saturday & Sunday. We introduced this to prevent the subreddit from being overwhelmed by low value/reposts during launch (e.g screenshots of the main menu/download status, and so on). However, now launch has come & gone, we think it's an appropriate time to readjust these restrictions.

Starting from now, **media posts will once again be allowed alongside text posts all week**, however, memes are still going to be limited to Saturday & Sunday only. 

We will of course review this after a week or two, just to see how the sub feels, as it's a pretty big deviation from what has been the norm here since launch. We'd just ask that you ensure the proper flair is applied to any posts submitted and that the community guidelines are followed as always.

As always, please feel free to send us any feedback you have regarding this change.

So, I was playing through the quest ""Automatic Love"", the other day. Didn't expect the quest to be such a good one, I'm going to be honest. There is this part where you interact with Skye or Angel, and it turns out to be a fleeting moment of catharsis and emotional connection in a world that is unabashedly superficial and unforgiving. The juxtaposition of the situation was a prime example of the love and passion of the devs towards crafting a meaningful storyline. 

And then, when all is done, the Doll's AI logs out, and she reverts back to her self. But so does V, acting completely crass and demeaning towards the Doll. When you ask her about Evelyn and she answers, all V can say is: ""So you were useful after all"". Now this might sound nitpicky, but this completely takes away immersion from the game and almost makes V feel like a caricature rather than a real character. He practically had one of the most emotional, raw and refreshing experiences since his accident, and found warmth, compassion and understanding from someone, but it doesn't reflect in behaviour towards Skye/Angel (I played Skye, maybe things are different for Angel) at all. 

The inconsistency was what ruined the questline for me, honestly and this is a major gripe I have with this game.  While the NPCs are very well fleshed out, there aren't enough dialogue options for V to react to various situations, heavily dampening the RPG situations. Furthermore, I'm 20 hours in and it doesn't really feel like your choices affect your dynamics with various players of Night City either. I expected a tabletop RPG experience that completely immerses you in the day to day of Night City, but it is another generic Open world adventure with just the right amount of gimmicks to keep you invested. Still a good game with a solid storyline, but not what it was hyped up to be.";0;438;438;106;1;1

---

So after Jackie dies after the end of act 1, you have to choose where to send his body. Turns out that sending him to Viktor has his body taken away (which is what I did). From what I read online, you get a funeral scene when sending him to Mama Welles.

Now, in the act 2 mission ""Gimme Danger"", Takemura tells V that Jackie's body was taken by Arasaka, and that they use the Soul Killer thingy to copy his psyche off his dead body and... do stuff to it, I guess. Which is kinda horrible.

Right after telling this to V, Takemura gets back to the regular quest dialogue. V doesn't seem too fazed by this (or he does, for one line of dialogue).

I really hope there will be more to this in the game? Like a way to get Jackie's body back (I haven't played much beyond ""Gimme Danger"" yet, btw)?

Also, on the topic of Takemura, are there some scenes missing where he learns about how Saburo Arasaka was killed? After picking up V from the dump he says on the phone that he ""found the killer"". Immediately after in the car, he seems to be on V's side, hunted by Arasaka, and, as he later says, ""stripped of his implants""? He even mentions, before meeting Hanako's bodyguard Oda, to ""tell him everything you told me"" - when did V tell Takemura anything?";0;21;21;28;0;0

* Fixed an issue with not receiving new calls or messages after *Pyramid Song* has been abandoned midway.
* Fixed an issue whereby Delamain core could be already broken when player enters the Core room in *Don't Lose Your Mind*.
* Fixed issues with Delamain not appearing or doing nothing outside the Afterlife in *The Heist*.
* Fixed an issue with objective getting stuck on ""Talk to Viktor"" in The Ripperdoc.
* Fixed an issue whereby it was impossible to talk to the bouncer in front of Lizzie's in *The Information*.
* Added description for *Don't Lose Your Mind* in the Journal.
* Fixed an issue preventing player from saving, using fast travels, and talking to other NPCs after reloading a save with an active call with Frank in *War Pigs*.
* Fixed an issue with Panam not calling about any other matter until *I'll Fly Away* is completed.
* Fixed an issue with Dum Dum following V after *The Pickup* is finished.

**Gameplay**

* Improved the reaction times of NPCs taking cover.
* Corrected the number of shots needed to kill civilians from a distance while in combat.

**Visual**

* Fixed an issue with Delamain's image displayed on top of the current caller during phone calls.
* V's mouth doesn't stay open after entering the space lock in *Where is My Mind*.
* Fixed some UI overlap issues.
* V appears more modest in the inventory preview after the half year montage ;)
* NPCs are faster to appear in the quest area during Stadium Love.
* Added some warmth to HDR.
* Fixed T-posing NPCs in *Suspected Organized Crime Activity: Just Say No* and *Gig: Hot Merchandise*.
* Fixed an issue whereby after a braindance it was possible to be stuck in 3rd person view with no head.
* Silencer icons are no longer displayed with no image in the inventory.

**UI**

* Fixed an issue with weapon crosshair persisting on screen.
* The inventory menu no longer closes immediately after opening it for the first time after leaving a car.
* Fixed an issue whereby upon accessing a fast travel terminal the button shown on the top right corner prompting to open the quest journal would not work.

**Performance & Stability**

* Multiple stability improvements, including crash fixes.

**Miscellaneous**

* Offscreen explosions make noise now.

**PC-specific**

* \[AMD SMT\] Optimized default core/thread utilization for 4-core and 6-core AMD Ryzen(tm) processors. 8-core, 12-core and 16-core processors remain unchanged and behaving as intended. This change was implemented in cooperation with AMD and based on tests on both sides indicating that performance improvement occurs only on CPUs with 6 cores and less.
* Fixed an issue with the way Raw Input is collected.
* Removed the use of AVX instruction set thus fixing crashes occurring at the end of the Prologue on processors not supporting AVX.
* Removed debug console to prevent functions that could lead to crashes or blocked quests. This doesn't mean we don't want to support the modding community. Stay tuned for more info on that.
* Ray traced reflections should no longer seem too bright in comparison to the environment.
* Fixed an issue with Steam Overlay crash on game shutdown.
* Removed the memory\_pool\_budgets.csv file. which was not connected with the final version of the game and had no influence on it (it was a leftover file used during the development to estimate memory usage. It had no effect on how much memory was actually allocated). Perceived performance increase after editing the file may have been related to restarting the game.

**Console-specific**

* Improved image sharpness with Chromatic Aberration and Film Grain on.
* Settings should no longer reset to default after several game session restarts.
* Fixed visual issues occurring during the transition between *The Heist* and *Love Like Fire*.

* Telemetry consent request will appear once more due to an earlier issue with settings reset.
* Fixed an issue whereby it was possible to fall down the elevator shaft in Megabuilding H8 in *Automatic Love.*

[Free Talk](https://preview.redd.it/trkbvtvko0461.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82bd275ab85d7b1258f425476afa59ee2d0c3425)

As per the title, the subreddit currently has *’Free Talk’* and this means that there will be relaxed moderation of rules 1 and 7.

This means that you can post your random Cyberpunk 2077 discussions, even if they may not be OC/making a new point.

A couple of examples are:

* Basic polls, like, ‘What lifepath did you choose?’
* Hype posts, like, ‘This is why Cyberpunk 2077 changed my life'
* Battlestation posts, sharing your PC or console setup with a Cyberpunk 2077 theme

We will also be relaxing our moderation of rule 7, which means that you can post your Cyberpunk 2077 themed memes! Please note that they will still be subject to removal due to user reports.";0;555;555;533;0;0

This essentially means you can't craft, collect, and do everything in the game like any other open world RPG. The devs recommend not collecting a bunch of items and pretty much not crafting a ton. Beat the story and start over. This is bullshit and should be brought to their attention by a ton of people so they can sort this out ASAP. They said they MIGHT raise the size higher. 

What the fuck?????

This game is one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced, I've never had so much emotional investment into a character I've made, and I don't know if it will ever be topped by another. The past few years of my life haven't been the easiest, I've lost friends and nearly lost myself a few times, but one thing that always kept me going was ""I want to play Cyberpunk"". Now the time has come and I've played the game, it's astonishingly beautiful and hopefully it can keep me going a little while longer.

Since the game's release a lot of the focus has been on how the game performs and the misleading from the marketing. I just wanted to take some time to really show how much I appreciate this game and the people that have worked to make it. So if anyone from CDPR sees this, or if they even check the subreddit, I want to say thank you. What you have created is a masterpiece that will only be remembered fondly in my mind. Now go take a break over the holidays because you, more than, deserve it.

Edit: Top Tip! Don't ever bother trying to say anything positive about this game because people can't seem to grasp the concept of someone enjoying a game that they didn't

Hey everyone!

The mods have finally spoken. Congrats to /u/Erahall for providing this amazing [photo of Wakako](https://imgur.com/a/TId8MuY). We hope you enjoy the gear. 

Although they didn’t win, we figured we’d drop a few honorable mentions:

Sup Choombas,

Team Razer here! We hope everyone is enjoying the sights and sounds of Night City this holiday season as much as we are. Since it’s the season of giving, we figured what better way to show it than with a little giveaway, Night City-style.

Up for grabs is our Razer X Cyberpunk 2077 licensed gear, which includes a Viper Ultimate gaming mouse, Gigantus (Size L) mouse mat, and Arctech Pro phone case. To enter, simply **show us the best photo you’ve taken in Cyberpunk 2077’s photo mode**. Photos must be direct from the game, no editing from any outside software allowed.

One winner will be selected by the mods from both r/Cyberpunkgame and r/NightCityFashion on January 4th PST. Get snapping, chooms.";0;2128;2128;1886;1;11

PS:

To anyone reading from the sub itself: **Yes I know that the chance that all of this if anything gets added is next to ZERO and I am not deluding myself, that the game we got now is the game we are going to have in 1 or 2 years time from now is the same just with fewer bugs and better performance.

This list is for them to look at, get feedback, and see how they could improve their reputation and make good on their promise, not implement all that.**

490;kisijj;Question;[SPOILER][Level 41 Nomad] (Don't Fear) The Reaper - What's the Recommended Level;2020-12-23;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kisijj/spoilerlevel_41_nomad_dont_fear_the_reaper_whats/;"I've googled around a bit, and I can't really find any straight answers - I guess this is a mission that leads to a secret ending from what it sounds like? But I threw myself at it at level 38, and yeah... it did not go well. I'd been playing the game on Very Hard up until that point, but I tried turning it down to easy... it... did not help.     
    
I gave it a bunch of tries even though I was blatantly underlevelled - had Johnny's pistol, that iconic sniper that has explosive rounds, and the cattleprod melee from the River questline. In my best attempt, I spent like half an hour whittling down the enemies - got through the 4 in the foyer, grenaded the missile launchers of the mechs then beat them to death with my prod, then went through like 2-3 waves of guys coming out of the elevators until one dropped a passcode  and I ran out of grenades - tried to run for the elevator, called it, but died before the elevator came down. I'm not exactly keen go through that struggle again... so I reloaded my save from before the point of no return and have gone off to grind a bit.    
    
But yeah, spiel over - given that 38 is obviously not high enough... what kind of level is recommended for this mission? As per the title, I've grinded up to level 41 off mostly side jobs, but it seems like I'm running out of side jobs to do, and every video I look up to try and get an idea of what level I should be has the person at level 50 - do I really have to grind up that far? Or is it more doable at a bit less?  
  
**Post-success-Edit for people that might land here after googling the same question I had**: I did manage to do it eventually, but I had to grind up to level 50. I tried it again at level 44, and it made little to no difference over the level 38 attempt - every enemy besides the two bulkier guys right at the start were still Skulled. Still had to spend ages beating the mechs to death with a stick. Managed to make it to the penultimate room after a couple of tries, but died there - came back at level 50, and it was pretty painless by comparison - still a reasonable challenge, but most of the enemies were actually killable in a reasonable amount of time, and the only skulled enemy was >!the final boss!<.  
  
Between the lack of skulls at level 50, and the enemies in the mission dropping level 50 loot, I'd sy the recommended level would be level 50. You could certainly do it at a lower level (maybe anyway, final boss might be a sticking point), but it is a long, harsh slog under level 50.";0;10;10;27;0;0

It's not perfect, I think the Witcher 3 was better, but what we've got is a very beautiful and fun game with excellent characters and world building. The combat is pretty basic and the bugs are truly insane but for all that I've still sunk 100 hours into it and have no sign of stopping. CDPR clearly had a difficult development cycle with this game and the hype around it was way overblown to the point of absurdity but what they managed to deliver is still fantastic. I know some stuff got cut and the console versions are not especially great (okay they're downright broken on last gen) but from my place of privilege as a PC gamer with a pretty high end system, I'm happy with what I got. I just want to put that out there because the people that made this game did a damn good job and I want them to know it. 2020 has been a pretty awful year for just about everybody and I'd like to try and put a little positivity into the world in the final days of this horrible year.

I don't know why, I just like to check if the game offers anything unique for the current situation. I guess I got it from tv shows, it is one of my favorite things to do in a roleplay setting, a person just calling and talking onto voicemail of a departed or missing loved one.

So after act 1 when the obvious thing happens, I tried to call Jackie and surprised to found myself being able to leave a message and even a sincere one at that. It was touching.

The more I played through the story, the more I called him and V updated Jackie with new voicemails, like the new stuff that happens, V can keep calling Jackie to update him about the story.

I just called him again at much later in the story and V said ""this might be the last time I call you."" I felt the emotions now. Real shit. 

So guys, you can give a call to Jackie and not just once, several times throughout the story. Don't forget the big guy. It's nice stuff.";0;1053;1053;107;0;0

But for me it is! Let me tell you about it. 'Cause it makes me feel awesome and in a crazy, shitty year 2020 has been, this is the best thing that happened to me!

I have been a gamer all my life (F34) and I've played many, many RPG's. I've pursued many digital romances, with straight, gay and bi characters. I usually play my first playthrough as a female, 2nd one as a male. I have fond memories of playing as female Shepard for instance. 

But never has a romance option and storyline touched me as much as V's & Judy's. The storytelling itself, the character development, the 'tenderness' in their interaction when you get to the romance sidequest. It made me feel all warm & mushy inside, like Judy would say.

It made me feel things I never experienced like this before. I've always been 'bi-curious', but have always tucked those feelings far away 'cause of my traditional parents and not feeling confident enough to totally be myself. I've lived with those feelings for many years now, locked away in my mind, accepting the fact that I would just date guys and that would be it for me.

But not anymore! V's romance with Judy was so heartwarming to me that it gave me the courage to contact a girl I've liked for years, but never dared to act on it. And because Cyberpunk 2077 inspired me with the storytelling there was only one thing I could suggest to her for a date. So yes... we are going diving in the beginning of next year!

Just wanted to share this. It feels like a real Christmas miracle to me and I couldn't be happier!

Yeah I don’t know how to describe it, I play on Xbox one and while it has it flaws (FPS,resolution, etc, etc) I’ve genuinely enjoyed the game so much. I’ve had a battle with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. But now that I’ve played it I’ve had a genuine smile on my face for the first time in a long time. It’s my virtual therapy that takes me away from the pain and makes me forget it all. I loved this game so much so far that I’ve decided to now build a pc to fix those problems I have on Xbox one. That’ll take time but I’m so excited to have that experience.

For y’all wondering I’m 30 hours into my first play through, still not done with main campaign due to me wanting to get the best ending possible. So I’m doing every side quest I feel is important to story.

Thank you CD projekt RED for finally giving me a smile.


Edit: hey guys thanks for telling me I need to find help and not just use cyber punk! Letting y’all know I’ve been going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist for a bout 4 months now also I go to gym for atleast a hour every day. Cyberpunk is just one of those escapes I have at home that makes me feel better. Thanks for all the support I’m new to Reddit so I’m still learning I just wanted to share my story?";0;367;367;109;0;2

He often appears in sidequests with some meaningful interactions/conversations which deepen Johhny's character and lore. I totally get now how he had the most lines to record after V.

Similarly to the Witcher 3, it's kind of amazing how a sidequest may be a routine 'clear camp' situation or a multi-quest detective story that introduces a new romance option and hours of content. You never know if you've missed some gold-vein.

376;kp6mwq;Love;Cyberpunk 2077 is a Masterpiece Riddled with Bugs, but Still Ultimately Worth Playing;2021-01-02;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kp6mwq/cyberpunk_2077_is_a_masterpiece_riddled_with_bugs/;"So I recently beat the game, 126 hours to get all achievements and clear the map. I just had so much fun with the experience. I love cyberpunk fiction, Shadowrun, etc. and I also love first-person shooters, so this was just about the perfect game for me.

Granted, there were a lot of bugs and general janky behavior (especially the physics and AI) but ultimately I would say the story and the graphics make up for the rough edges. Especially if you do all the side missions, there are some amazing moments there. The Peralez quest, that scene in the diner, Brendan, the BD hustler, etc. The story is just on another level, very mature themes are touched on (and I don't just mean the sex scenes, but that too).

I played on PC, with a 2080 Ti, so I got to use ray tracing and almost all ultra settings. The graphics were just incredible. The lighting and reflections are second to none. It's sad the optimization was not there, especially on older PCs or consoles, but on the right setup it really is amazing.

All things said, I think the game is a masterpiece that unfortunately needed about 6 more months in the oven. It's unfinished, riddled with bugs, but I loved it and had the most amazing experience of any game I've played. 

Hopefully CDPR will fix the broken bits and release a definitive edition later this year that will be what the game was supposed to be. I know all the cut content is not coming back, but if they can fix what's there already I think this will be up there as one of the best games of all time. If you haven't started it yet, maybe wait a month or two for the patches to come, but this is a game that should not be missed.";0;183;183;188;1;0

I know hindsight is 2020, but I'm not an impatient person, and I'm certainly not rude and dumb enough to take work off for the game and be immensely disappointed by it's delay. I think, if a year is what they would have needed to play test the fuck out of this game and iron out the bugs, they could have absolutely had time to build the hype back up and have a big release. So I'm curious, would you have been okay with them delaying the game? Or do you think they should have had it done on time? Is the game still redeemable in your eyes?;0;4519;4519;1255;0;6

I used to play video games a solid amount, not so much anymore. Pre-release I've only heard this game is like Cyberpunk Skyrim or Fallout, another of those ""you can do anything and be anyone you want for hundreds and hundreds of hours"" open world types of games. I enjoy those games sure, but there are so many that I don't and didn't have any strong feelings or real interest in yet another one. Thought I would play it a couple years down the road if I had nothing better to do. Haven't really ever paid attention to the games company CDPR either but I've been seeing their name around while browsing almost as much as I have Cyberpunk. I was really interested in playing the Witcher 2 a few years ago so I thought I would start from the beginning before I played that and bought Witcher 1 but I absolutely loathed that game with a passion. I thought it wasn't fun whatsoever and completely unengaging. I didn't get very far in because I wasn't enjoying myself at all. Completely turned me off to the rest of the series and about 80% of the news surrounding this game aside from tidbits like customizing your junk and it being the new Skyrim.

My girlfriend loves story-driven and open world games with lots of choices to make, her favorite being Horizon: Zero Dawn, close second Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Detroit: Become Human her third, she's on a mission to unlock all the different scenes and possibilities in that game. She also adores the Uncharted series and Until Dawn while on the flip side of what she doesn't like, she despised the new Last of Us despite loving the first and Ghost of Tsushima put her to sleep (don't know how, that's one of my recent favorites I've recently played though but it's her opinion lol, so whatever). She got into Skyrim this year and absolutely loves bullying the NPCs, factions she hates and just generally messing around in the open world, so I wanted to get her another game like it. From my limited knowledge of this game, it sounded like it would be right up her alley.

Now that this game has dropped apparently it isn't an open world RPG like Skyrim and it's something else? After going through this subreddit and reviews I still have no idea what kind of game this is. Every time I look at a video it looks like an RPG, then I look at the comments and many people are lambasting it for not being one. It's even listed as ""role-playing"" video game in quotes on the sidebar as if it's pretending to be that but it isn't what it actually is.

I'm not going to lie, as an outside party I'm enjoying all the drama surrounding the bugs and glitches that I've seen so far but it isn't really helping me decide if I should get it as a gift for someone who might enjoy it.

Is the story decent? Is it just make your character and become a super criminal GTA style? If it isn't an RPG, then what is it? If someone could provide some clarity on what this game actually is and what it's most similar to so I can make an informed decision, I would sincerely appreciate it.";0;1;1;35;0;0

79;krjndz;Discussion;I think the big reason for Cyberpunk's mixed reception is because it's a contradiction to itself - a dichotomy of the best and worst in one game.;2021-01-06;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/krjndz/i_think_the_big_reason_for_cyberpunks_mixed/;"Cyberpunk is somehow one of the best games ever created and one of the worst.

I think this is what has caused the negative attention that it has received.

>Aesthetics, style and atmosphere are among the best ever created

* But you're constantly brought out of it by visual bugs, T-Posing and gameplay problems

>Weapon modding, crafting and variety allows for truly customised builds

* But the Borderlands ""Loot Piñata"" style loot system means that you spend most of your time wearing booty shorts with a high-vis jacket and using the same weapon for 14 levels because everything is shit for your build.

>Some of the quests make amazing use of systems, world-building and narrative devices to create moving, powerful, dark or heartwarming moments that have never been brought to life in such a way before.

* But they're interspersed with hundreds of ""Go here, kill him, get loot piñata"" quests.

>Beautiful graphics and a huge variety of settings to allow, theoretically, anyone to enjoy the game regardless of their system while also allowing those with the best machines to experience something that pushes current technology to its limits to create something beautiful

* Except between a myopic last-gen release, memory leaks, unexplained poor performance and countless bugs, crashes and visual errors, many aren't even able to play it at all and those that can don't see half of the game's visual potential.

>When it's at its best, ads clashing together over street noise with club music playing and idle NPC chatter - the audio world is genuinely alive in a way I've never felt before.

* And when it's at its worst, you get the same stupid techno music playing loudly over everything for 10 minutes as you try to find some guard stuck in a corner.

>The pedestrian variety, behaviour and presence really makes you feel like you're in a real world with fashion, attitudes and lives affected by the cyberpunk universe.

* But then you see three people with the exact same model and clothing walking down the street together, until one screams at nothing and sprints away shouting ""CYBERPSYCHO!!! HE'S GOT A GUN""

>Phenomenal variety of vehicles. Not just in style but handling, performance, price and feel. Many of the vehicles really capture the intended sense when you drive them, be it the ""Best I can afford"" electric minis or the ""Best money can buy"" hypercars.

* But then they fishtail out of control at the slightest touch and explode at random, all while driving on a system that gives you 3/8ths of a second to react to a turn and police who'll happily spawn and destroy your car for looking at a pedestrian funny.

>A fully integrated hypersexual world where prostitution, pornography and casual sex are openly discussed and advertised. Almost a first for mainstream gaming.

* Except almost all of it is entirely superficial and it loses its charm after the 34th MILFguard ad in a single play-session moans at you again, without any other nudity in the last 6 hours of gameplay.

>Meticulously created levels with multiple ways in and out of buildings, hacking options and other covert tools to let you take missions however you want.

* Except the guards go on high alert at nothing, enter combat seemingly at random and are somehow both prescient and telepathic, yet unable to see somebody crouching 2 feet away from them.

>Little tidbits in quests that show the devs were often thinking about the different ways people play - like Panam calling out if you catch up to her, or V commenting that ""nobody is coming"" when a corpo calls for security after you've painstakingly disabled all the gaurds.

* Yet somehow major pieces feel missing, some quests feel shortened, other important seeming events disappear without closure.

>A whole game built with so much love, passion, art and creative direction.

* But let down by countless little flaws and signs that, somewhere along the way, somebody took the reigns who never should have had them.

We were promised smart AI and customizations and buying property and exploration and got none of that stuff. But we DID get ALL the stuff in a Far Cry game.

-Good main story where you play the part of the Protagonist, with no real choices in how things play out. You are Jason Brody, or in this case, V, an already established personality you didn't build.

-Interesting, well-written characters with good dialogue. I think CDPR's writing is better than Ubisoft's, but it's close enough, I think.

-Fun side quests that largely involve killing a camp of enemies. Sometimes you get to rescue someone!

-You cannot change the world around you in any way outside of the main quest. There are no factions to develop relationships with, killing 500 people doesn't really affect anything. 

-You spend your entire time doing side quests and progressing the main plot, then you're done. No reason to go back, really.

That's Cyberpunk. We were sold a Next-Gen RPG with ALL the cool stuff in games we've played before, from many genres, and all they could manage to get done before release was a really good Far Cry game.

It's clear they INTENDED to have all these neat features in their game, and even started working on many, if not ALL of them. But at some point the decision was made to cut them and just ship the game. 

Cyberpunk is a blast to play, for sure. I love driving around town, murdering Maelstrom thugs and having Johnny show up sometimes to be snarky. 

But it's not what we were promised. And that sucks. 

The graphics are mind-blowingly beautiful and immersive. Just don't look too close at all the stuff you CAN'T do.";0;287;287;366;0;3

* Hype posts, like, ‘This is why Cyberpunk 2077 changed my life'
* Battlestation posts, sharing your PC or console setup with a Cyberpunk 2077 theme

We will also be relaxing our moderation of rule 7, which means that you can post your Cyberpunk 2077 themed memes! Please note that they will still be subject to removal due to user reports.";0;65;65;142;0;0

Panam's and Judy's reactions in the credits really got to me, and I realised what I'd be putting my real-life family through if I carried through what I had been thinking the past three to four weeks. 

I still do feel quite terrible, and it's a long, hard climb up; however, if there's one thing the game taught me, it's that I can't do this to the people around me, and there are still things worth living for. 

Thanks, CDPR, for putting this ending in. Thanks for helping me pull myself out of the abyss.

Thanks to everyone who posted. It's been really heartening to read all of your responses and has strengthened my resolve. I think I'm going to seek some professional help, and I'm glad that the game helped me there too. You guys are great chooms. I wish you all all the best.

I also realise that I forgot to mark the post as a spoiler, so people scrolling past (and who haven't completed the game) might've gotten the ending spoilt. I screwed up, I'm terribly sorry—I didn't really know how spoiler tags worked the first time around and I *think* I've fixed it now.

What do you think? Is he addressing all the issues of the game (including the false promises)? Is the comparison with The Witcher 3 fair on the state of the game? Are you planning to send him your feedback? If so, could you please share it here?

115;kuaju5;News;Another bad news for CDPR. Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) will monitor the progress of work on patches. If CDPR fails to deliver them, they may be punished with a fine of up to 10% of their income in the previous year.;2021-01-10;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kuaju5/another_bad_news_for_cdpr_polish_office_of/;"[https://www.benchmark.pl/aktualnosci/nad-cyberpunk-2077-pochyla-sie-nawet-uokik.html](https://www.benchmark.pl/aktualnosci/nad-cyberpunk-2077-pochyla-sie-nawet-uokik.html)

The troubles with the premiere of Cyberpunk 2077 do not end. As it turns out, the game's premiere even interested UOKiK.

While in the case of PC versions, the ratings for Cyberpunk 2077 are good or even very good (despite visible errors), the console versions proved to be very disappointing. For some people it was even unplayable, so there were a lot of players asking for returns, and Sony even decided to remove the game from PlayStation Store. Additionally, due to problems with the game, CD Projekt Red stock price falls which resulted in class actions against the company. Now the UOKiK is also interested in Cyberpunk problems.

*Dziennik Gazeta Prawna* was the first to inform about it. Małgorzata Cieloch, the spokesperson of the UOKiK, explained the scope of control. As she stated, it is primarily a matter of checking the progress of work on the promised patches, which should make the console versions of the game playable.

>We ask the entrepreneur to explain the problems with the game and actions taken by them. We will check how the producer is working on making corrections or solving difficulties that make it impossible to play on consoles, but also how he intends to act towards people who have made complaints and are dissatisfied with the purchase due to the lack of possibility to play the game on their equipment despite previous assurances of the producer.

At this point, it is difficult to conclude whether CD Projekt will be punished. The decision, in this case, will depend on what explanations the representatives of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection will hear in these cases. The company will certainly not underestimate this, as the UOKiK president's decision may result in a fine of up to 10% of the annual revenue. This is of course the worst scenario from CD Projekt's point of view.

We will probably hear more about the case. Let us remind you that despite a lot of confusion and problems, the sale of Cyberpunk 2077 is performing very well. After 10 days from the release, the game has found 13 million buyers, now the result is probably much higher.

Not because the characters personalities are written like that but because the game doesn't take into consideration what missions you have done when exploring the city.

One moment my V is having a nice chat with Johnny and asking him to help him out like two best friends, the next moment im sitting in a diner and V is telling Johnny to fuck off and acting like they just met (which they according to the story did)

&#x200B;

Wish the game would lock some of the interactions with Johnny until you have progressed in the main story up to the point where it would make sense for them to act the way they do.

Now it just goes, V hates Johnny --> V suddenly Johnny's best friend ---> V once again treats Johnny like they met ---> ""WAKE THE FUCK UP SAMURAI, YOU WANNA SEE MY COCK""";0;2152;2152;491;0;3

The time has come and a new update have to be posted. Last time I've posted about the internally developed MM but today will be different! We now have had a bit more time between the last post and this one and this is regarding holidays and people who got ill. But with start 2021 development of tools come and take a new turn. We as well came into contact with CDPR, but about that later in this post.

Our current progress can be viewed as following in 2 main topics: Scripted Modding and Content Modding.

1. Scripted Modding:With CET ( Cyber Engine Tweaks ) out console enabler and script library we have made the first step into creating a framework for the community to create mods by their own. With Lua you can make scripts and load them during gameplay or at the start of the game. We are actively developing and dropping debug versions of the tool in our for test of upcoming changes for Modders. During the time we have made big jumps in development and added a lot of new content and stuff to the Mod to make new good mods for everyone! A big thank you for Yamashi to initially creating the Mod and WhySoSerious to being on of the most active in developing and improving the Mod.Examples:- CET Ingame Mod Manager by Natsji at [nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/895)\- CYBER H4CK by specikk at [nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/808)\- Vehicle Unlocker by specikk at [nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/922)

&#x200B;

1. Content Modding:With the WolvenKit creators ( who have initially initiated the project of Modding CP77 ) we are coming closer and closer to being able to fully port / add functionality to Mod Cyberpunk 2077 with WolvenKit and add new content as well as edit existing one! But until this is done we have our CLI based tool called ""CP77Tools"" (original I know :D ) that is allowing us unpack and pack( !experiment! ) .archive files to allow edits of files and look at them directly. It even has more functions, but for more info join our [discord](https://discord.gg/cp77modding) or take a look the [github respo](https://github.com/WolvenKit/CP77Tools). A big thank your for rfuzzo to make the CP77Tools and the both rfuzzo and Traderain for WolvenKit and the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 Support!

  
**(EDIT)**  
With a lot of notice thanks to users on the Discord, I have noticed to forgot to add a specific tool developed by WopsS: RED4ext!  

RED4ext is a library that extends REDengine 4. It will allow modders to add new features, modify the game behavior, add new scripting functions or call existing ones in your own plugins.

This library is similar to [Script Hook V](http://dev-c.com/GTAV/scripthookv). A BIG thank you to you WopsS and Yamashi! 

&#x200B;

Now about the contact with CDPR. CDPR has been going through a lot of stuff lately with Cyberpunk 2077 and they have come to see that involving us as the community is a good idea. We at the CP77 Modding Tools team are working on open source tools for everyone to extend the lifetime of the game and quality. We are thus honoured to have heard from CDPR openly encouraging the modding community and wanting to add mod support. But until now we haven't heard about much at all. That has changed today (01.15.2021) as Traderain one of the head developers and creator of WolvenKit updated everyone one the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cp77modding) that he and rfuzzo have been in contact with CD Project Red and got the news about how much they are supporting our work and what we are doing and is actively  now helping us. First step is by releasing a nearly completely list of game files, that would have taken additional month or even more, to brute force from the packed .archive files, as well as not being able to do due to unreleased stuff and how our tool works. ( We are certain the missing hashes we now need to actually complete our list are simple files that are unnecessary to create our tools as they are either ripped content or copy right stuff that they are now allowed to actively give us like that. ) Of course this won't be the end of our partnership with CDPR but that it for now all we can say.

All we can do now is being eager and continue creating tools and we would be happy to get more helping hand for coding! If you have experience and love to work with us, come join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/cp77modding) and talk with us about what we do, as well as talk a look at our [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/WolvenKit) with our main content. We are also welcoming those who want to help us in a different way, by either contributing to the Wiki at [wiki.cybermods.net](https://wiki.cybermods.net) or elsewhere.

Until then cheers,Your CP77 Modding Tools team!";0;879;879;268;0;12

Notable Quotes:

>""Much of CD Projekt’s focus, according to several people who worked on Cyberpunk 2077, *was on impressing the outside world*. A slice of gameplay was showcased at E3, the industry’s main trade event, in 2018""  
>  
>""Fans and journalists were wowed by Cyberpunk 2077’s ambition and scale. What they didn’t know was that **the demo was almost entirely fake**. CD Projekt hadn’t yet finalized and coded the underlying gameplay systems.""

Seems as though the single 2018 E3 demo served as the foundation/core of the final product of the game.

>""The overtime didn’t make development of the game any faster. At E3 in June 2019, CD Projekt announced that the game would come out on April 16, 2020. *Fans were elated, but internally, some members of the team could only scratch their heads, wondering how they could possibly finish the game by then.* One person said they thought the date was a joke. Based on the team’s progress, they expected the game to be ready in 2022. **Developers** created memes about the game getting delayed, making bets on when it would happen.""  
>  
>""Some engineers realized that Cyberpunk was too complex of a game to run well on the seven-year-old consoles, with its city full of bustling crowds and hulking buildings. They said management dismissed their concerns, however, citing their success in pulling off The Witcher 3.""

If they planned this game out properly they would've killed two birds with one stone. In the proposed 2022 release date the conceptual gameplay features such as wall-running, vehicle customization (planned but never implemented), the flathead companion, and more, most likely would've been seen in the final release. In addition, the game could've been next-gen only, as it would have been enough time for more consumers to get their hands on the said next-gen consoles.

\^Of course, these are just my opinions in theory, as I'm just a fan of the game. I don't know how the development of gameplay would've progressed with a 2022 release, but the obvious fact remains that the team needed more time.

Personally, I still love the game. These game developers did their best to release the best product they could with the time given to them, along with working through COVID. Once you fall down you can only go upwards.

If anything I feel like this will be a huge lesson to management in the future that they acknowledge the opinions of their developers more.

An interesting quote which confirms some observations made after the apologies of the co-founder:

>And if we get a bit more granular about our release, the vision we presented in this demo evolved into something that got multiple 9/10s and 10/10s on PC from many renown gaming outlets in the world.  
>  
>As for the old-gen consoles, yes that is another case but we've owned up to that and are working super hard to eliminate bugs (on PC, too - we know that's not a perfect version either) and we are proud of Cyberpunk 2077 and artistic vision. This all is not what I'd call  disastrous.

To me, it seems that CPDR is pretty happy with the current version of the game (I mean, in terms of vision and gameplay). It sounds to me that they will be only focussing on resolving bugs, not necessarily adding substantially new features.

The number of times I'm creeping along and someone starts talking to me, and I go to stand up and face them, I end up skipping the dialogue. Or when someone's on the ground and I crouch to get closer to them, but end up skipping that line of dialogue that could be important information like a door code or something.

C or left Control are universally the crouch buttons in games, why the hell are you binding the ""Skip dialogue"" button to the crouch button? Sometimes its more cinematic to stand up or crouch down during a scene or moment to moment gameplay. The last thing I want to do is be stuck standing up, or crouching while listening to the dialogue when I could be going on with the objective, without having to risk missing critical information. Spacebar or enter I can understand, BUT FUCKING C?

Those scores would place Cyberpunk alongside the best games of all time, and anyone who played it knows there's not a single aspect of this game that deserves a perfect score, much less the whole package. PC version included.

So clearly those reviews were made for clicks (or for some other reason), much to the detriment of everyone who got fooled by them and ended up buying a broken mediocre game on false pretenses. Avoid those publications like the plague from now on.

Quick edit: 1 - I don't hate the game, don't think it deserves a flat zero, and don't see myself as part of a witch-hunt. 
2 - The subjectivity argument is always valid (any review is inherently subjective), but **professional** reviewers are trusted to strike a balance between subjective (love the music, art style, characters) and objective (broken mechanics, mediocre plot line, repetitive gameplay, clunky interface), because they should compare the game they're reviewing to other games in the genre and to the medium in general. And looking at other RPGs, ARPGs and open world games, you can see this one is mediocre (at best) in almost every single aspect.";0;512;512;505;0;1

In TW3 Geralt was looking for Ciri, and in Fallout 4 the sole survivor had to find Shaun but even those games didn't make the player character this desperate.

Why can't the open world games today be like good old Skyrim where you are allowed to do pretty much anything from the start and not bound by certain plot conditions? The basic setting of this game started all wrong and I don't see the way how to save this game.";0;2554;2554;914;0;9

42;l0m0on;Discussion;Instead of implementing 150+ grindy NCPD gigs and reported crimes, CDPR should have focused on side quests and random encounters.;2021-01-19;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l0m0on/instead_of_implementing_150_grindy_ncpd_gigs_and/;"I've finished the game, I have over 200 hours play time, done all but one of the NCPD scanners and one of the side quests, both are bugged and require a patch to complete. 

It's just such a grind. Like don't get me wrong, it's fun doing the shooty shoot, then looting the box at the end, then going to the next marker...for the first few times. Then you realize every blip on the damn map is like this. This is honestly better implemented by Ubisoft, and even then, I'm tired of this monotonous open world design. 

I think instead of going the Skellige route, where its just a bunch of busy work that you feel like you need to complete just to get rid of the marker on the map because of your OCD, they should have focused their energy on side quests that make you want to explore Night City, not force you to. Ya know, kind of like the Peralez mission, that was my favorite in the game, I think that's what most of us were expecting. Idk, it's just kind of dissapointing in my opinion.

And to the people who are gonna shit on me, or say I'm beating a dead horse for coming to an objective conclusion about game design, with a slightly subjective attitude toward this game, that's fine, consider this a formal complaint. Love the game or hate it, there are key developmental issues with this title, regardless of what you think. There's no hate bandwagon, I'm just one of many who are seeing large, glaring issues with this game, that we ALL wanted to succeed, and if that bothers you because somehow you think this game is an absolute masterpiece, than I truly don't know what to tell you... do more of those NCPD scanners, and do them all again in your next two playthroughs, I suppose.

Edit: edited the final paragraph because people were getting confused saying that I was saying my opinion was fact.

I beat the game with a gun slinger and a hacker, got platinum trophy and did everything (that we know of). The main reason I even did a second playthrough was to get the secret ending because of that stupid fucking oil field conversation requirement I'm convinced is a bug. I'm not salty, I got my money's worth... unless they think they can charge me again down the road for a next gen copy.

I came into this game blind, completely un hyped. My first playthrough was mostly curiosity, I wanted to see what things did what they looked like and in that regard I was entertained enough to enjoy myself despite some of the things that were bothering me. I was bothered by obvious things like ai and driving, the bugs and glitches everyone kept talking about didn't bother me that much. The more I played the more empty and soulless it all felt.

The empty feeling really hit hard on my second playthrough. It felt like the only aspect to the game is the grind. I only wanted to do some advanced hacking and get the secret ending so I rushed to the good hacks and the painting, this is when I realized what took my first playthrough so long. Everything is so stupid expensive that if you don't cheat you will spend all day picking up EVERYTHING and managing your inventory. Let's face it, the world and game aren't enticing enough to do a second playthrough organically, choices don't matter beyond the oil field. So after duping some paintings my priority was leveling up to make my build, these were the last few soul crushing days of this game for me.

Go from question mark to question mark and bat to bat to kill 3-20 people and pick up a thing. Get a little experience, sigh open my map and get to the next one. Only the main story and important npc questlines were good or unique. Slowly grinding repetitive content in a grid pattern to get the street cred for implants and experience for perks, it sucks so hard. You get to the point where ignoring all the junk is as strenuous as picking it all up.

When you beat the game after doing all the side stuff there is actually nothing to do. Nothing at all. The world isn't interactive and there are no random or dynamic situations to encounter. So that was my experience, one playthrough of moderate enjoyment and interest followed immediately by the realization that this game is short, linear and empty. Only now do I realize how little there is to do. Barely a month later, that's sad. If you'd have told me back in December that I got more play time out of Avengers I would have legitimately thought you were crazy. This game is mostly good for virtual interaction to read lore from data shards, even then there are some good youtube videos that piece together lore that I'd rather watch. I recommend checking out Firespark's video on Mr Blue Eyes.

I came in with no expectations and still feel let down. I have since dug up some past and holy shit this game is barely a skeleton of what they promised. The fact it took the community weeks to create mods that add base features really got me wondering what the actual fuck happened. I don't even know how they plan to introduce dlc to a game with a final ending and character who is dying, Fallout 3 had to change their ending and I just don't see that happening here.

There are so many disappointments that I'm looking at how long my post is and thinking I've typed quite enough, pretty sure we're all mostly aware of all the could've and should've. Learning that pre production was scrapped and that they only really worked on the game for 4 years is obvious. Hubris. The thought that the ""bioware magic"" mentality hit CDPR is depressing.";0;723;723;528;0;4

Bugs and performance aside, there are features and content that were clearly promised by CDPR. Most of which didn't make the game. 

Eight million players purchased the game trusting them to deliver as literally advertised. It's common practice to cut the occasional feature, CDPR however dumped most key- and even some standard elements. The envisioned project turned out to be way out of their league.

I'm happy for those who are content with what they received, it does not however change the facts argued by those who are not.

The latest official statements made it very clear that CDPR does not intend to deliver in a NMS fashion. My guess is not because they choose to do so, but because it's simply beyond their capabilities.";0;3249;3249;1211;0;17

This caught me off guard and it was enrapturing, I loved it! I had not played any other game that had morally grey choices, with delayed consequences. 

Other games from other companies I had played up to that point, had obvious good & bad choices with immediate consequence on what I chose. CDPR has regressed with Cyberpunk 2077, who also falls into that category of games.

A lot of the public conversation around CP2077 centers around the obviously bad and good parts of the game. A buggy launch of a game, with missing open world features, but with great visuals, a highly detailed vertical city, with a blockbuster movie style of linear story telling (Attempting to be like a Naughty Dog game.)

The good parts of the game are fun and enjoyable, but those elements do not make up to be an RPG. The grey choices & delayed consequences of the Witcher series is what garnered CDPR a loyal player base. With CP2077, they appear to have forgotten what they were good at.";0;1708;1708;575;0;7

199;l1zvz4;News;r/cyberpunkgame Subreddit - January 2021 Updates and Changes;2021-01-21;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l1zvz4/rcyberpunkgame_subreddit_january_2021_updates_and/;"Hey choombas!

Firstly, happy 2021! We hope everyone managed to squeeze in a little CP2077 hellfire and romance during the holidays. This will be the first update post of the new year; we want to be fully transparent with what we’re doing behind the scenes. Not just admitting our shortcomings, but so that we’re all on the same page, and we want to make sure the subreddit reaches its full potential.


# New Moderators

Due to the holidays, there’s been a backlog of posts awaiting approval. We apologise for that, and we brought in a couple more chooms to help out. They’re already getting their hands dirty, so you should see your posts get approved more quickly compared to previous weeks.


# Spoilers - What’s A Spoiler?

Over the course of the year, the team will be continuously assessing what is considered a spoiler or not. Everybody is on different parts of the game, and we believe opening up unspoilered discussion should be done in a timely manner.

In saying that, **any discussions about the Prologue and Act 1 can now be posted without spoiler tags. However, spoilers in post titles are still not allowed.** This includes discussions and images of >!Jackie’s death, the Sandra Dorsett quest, Saburo Arasaka's death, the Relic and Johnny Silverhand's death!<. Posts regarding Act 2 will be allowed in the next month or so, followed by discussions past the Point of No Return. We’ll keep you updated as we go.


# AutoMod

We realise that AutoMod is a bit too strict, and the megathreads it points you to have been outdated for quite some time. We’ve given it an overhaul, as noted below:

1. Automod will no longer remove comments in accordance to the new spoilers rule, which includes comments regarding >!Jackie, Sandra, Saburo, Johnny and others from the prologue!<.
2. Posts flaired as a bug/issue will be redirected to the weekly PC/Console threads.
3. Posts flaired as a question will be redirected to the weekly FAQ/Simple Questions thread (If the post is intended to be a discussion, the discussion flair should be used)
4. Media posts are still in approval mode, though the rate of approving posts should be a lot faster thanks to the new moderators.


# Megathreads

We have too many megathreads. They’ve served their purpose during launch, but we’ve now given them an overhaul, and we’ll be refreshing them on a set schedule. Below are the changes:

* Monday: [FAQ/Simple Question thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/?f=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20FAQ%22) - Refreshed Weekly


 >We’ll be updating this overtime with answers to FAQs


* Wednesday: [Console Support](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/?f=flair\_name%3A%22Console%20Support%22) and [PC Support](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/?f=flair_name%3A%22PC%20Support%22) - Refreshed Weekly


 >Discussion of bugs/issues related to the respective platform should go here. We’ll also be reaching out to the users that have compiled some of these issues, to make it easier for everyone.


* Friday: [Lore/Cyberpunk world thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Lore%22) - Refreshed Weekly


 >This covers discussions and questions about the lore of CP2077 and its universe. This is refreshed every Friday to keep conversations going through Free Talk (as we realised these posts are often drowned out by the memes)


# Free Talk Weekend

We’ve already been enforcing this, but we want to reiterate that **we will only be allowing memes on Saturday and Sunday EST.** Some may slip past us outside the weekend and garner a lot of attention; these will be now approved, since the community has pretty much spoken for us. We apologise for the inconsistencies in the past, but we wanted to address this now to avoid any confusion.

Otherwise, unless it is high quality, memes will be removed outside of Free Talk Weekend. We also have our sister meme-specific subreddit r/DumDumDidNothingWrong for your daily meme dosage.


# Repeated Topics

Panam and Judy. It’s slightly died down now, but their asses were on the forefront of the subreddit for weeks, and it had become a repetition of the same scene (Judy in diving gear; Panam leaning over the window). These kinds of “repeated topics cycles” are always looked back on fondly in every subreddit, so we don’t want to be too strict with these.

However, we’ve temporarily decided to remove Panam and Judy ass posts under Rule 1. We’ll be allowing them again in the future, but for now, we believe removing them will make way for other media and game discussions. Who knows, maybe next week will prove to be Meredith and River’s time to shine, and we’ll again adjust accordingly once things start to become too repetitive.


# New Post Flairs

We’re also thinking of adding some new flairs. **We’ve already added two: the Character Build and Modding flair.** This should help streamline moderation and scrolling through posts in general. If you guys have any more suggestions, feel free to comment and we’ll see what we can do!



# Upcoming Game Updates

We will be allowing discussions about upcoming updates. We’ve decided to be pretty lenient with this (barring spoilers, obviously), as we will not consider these posts leaks. **Leaks will now only apply to completely new content that have not been officially released, which can include new questlines, or future DLC updates. Leaks do not include talking about an updated/overhauled version of something already in the game.**


That's all from us; hope to see you chooms around Night City!";0;94;94;62;0;2

11;l2cmno;Discussion;Act 1 feels like an introduction to a game that doesn't exist;2021-01-21;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l2cmno/act_1_feels_like_an_introduction_to_a_game_that/;"It almost doesn't even feel like the same game. You get introduced to unique mechanics, and outcomes to dialogue that have an effect, that rarely - if ever - get brought up again.

The Sandra Dorsett job is like a much more fleshed out rescue gig, it's basically a one off quest compared to other gigs. There's actually interaction with Trauma Team, and it has small bits of unique gameplay (like using the air hypo and checking biomonitor) that never come up again. It's also features the only destructable concrete wall in the entire game.

The car chases, scripted as they are, have mechanics you're lead to believe will come up more in the game, but never really do. No leaning out or firing out of a car besides on-rails story missions.

Even smaller things like going to Vik's to get upgraded get special treatment and animations you'll never see again. After that you'll get a buy menu. That is all.

The spiderbot gameplay was squandered in my opinion, but still added a different touch and pacing than seen in 95% of other missions. Ultimately stealth is a complete waste of time since everything devolves into 'kill everyone and grab or interact with the thing'. Even most main and large side missions are guilty of this, with few (if any) unique elements to them.

Meeting Maelstrom for the first time is one of a few missions where dialogue isn't just three ways to say the same exact thing. There are a few different ways to go about it, but you actually see the result of those choices in game later on. It's not much but it helps.

Act 1 is not perfect, but compared to the gameplay elements utilized after getting to act 2 there's real contrast. It's like going from a singleplayer game and being dropped into a shallow MMORPG sandbox where most of what you say and do has no real meaningful impact.";0;6369;6369;889;0;19

1;l2llhc;Discussion;It's okay to enjoy CP77. It's not okay to be in denial about its problems and censor criticism.;2021-01-22;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l2llhc/its_okay_to_enjoy_cp77_its_not_okay_to_be_in/;"To make this post simple:

- I enjoyed the game. I played through the story. I think the game is overall decent. I don't think it's a masterpiece.

- I do think we were misled and lied to about what this was supposed to be, with CDPR pulling a bait-and-switch as to what the vision of this game was supposed to be.

- Subjectively, the game can be enjoyed.

- Objectively, the release of this game was a botched fiasco.

- Those of you that are not acknowledging the game's (and the overall development and release situations) major problems are not helping. CDPR should be held to account, and constructive criticism should be upheld because without it, CDPR (and the industry in general) gets a free pass to assume that it's acceptable to do these kinds of things.

The amount of denial I'm seeing here is insane. In particular, I'm getting irritated with people who are legitimately upset and disappointed with this game being told that they don't want others who enjoy the game to be able to enjoy it. That's not what's happening here, with rare exceptions (mostly in the form of trolls/trolling).

It reminds me of those car owners who are blind brand-defenders with rose-colored glasses on, who say things like ""I don't buy American/GM brand cars, they're ALL lemons that constantly break down, I ONLY buy [insert Japanese/European make here] and have done so for decades"". Then when their Mercedes or Lexus has consistent problems or defects, it has ""quirks,"" as in a ""quirky"" Saab or Volvo. When their BMW acts up, it's being ""temperamental"" -- a much more benign term than the ""trashy"" or ""junk"" Oldsmobile that exhibited similar flaws.

Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to be much more than just a visually stunning experience. It's not unique in that department, there are many other visually beautiful games. It was also supposed to be far more than just a story-driven single player experience. Max Payne 3 (and in general, the whole Max Payne franchise) is an incredible single-player focused story-driven experience, and was marketed as such. CP77 was supposed to be more than just an impressive single player narrative, but the vision and direction was for some reason totally changed in the last few years of its development and took a different direction. That's what I'm referring to when I said CDPR pulled a bait-and-switch.";0;28340;28340;3229;1;98

**Update**: Tested the non functioning (Partially or Not Working) perks/items for the 1.11 hotfix. Several changes noted in the change log. I think I'll reserve testing the whole list for more significant updates, but definitely looking out for people posting/messaging about things they found that are not working/working.

   * Not Working
      * Only tested on Knocked Down enemies. Staggering with Carnage barely leaves any time to fire again

# Intelligence - Quickhacking

* Bloodware: ""Quickhacks deal 10% more damage.""

   * Partially Working
      * This works in a very different way than described. The description should read ""Resets your RAM to 2/3/4 when you reach 0 RAM and have not initiated ANY recovery of RAM at all."" The last part meaning you have to actually 0 out and if any recovery happens along the way, it does not work. Recovery can be stalled with opening your menu or spamming lower level quickhacks with low cost, or doing what I did: Found a perfect combination of quickhack costs to execute on a group of enemies to 0 out immediately.

* Cutting Edge: ""Improves damages and all damage-related stats of crafted weapons by 5%.""
   * Partially Working
      * Still not working on Melee. Keep in mind for Ranged, a 5% increase in all the stats is actually a lot more than 5% increase in overall DPS in the end

# Technical Abilities - Engineering

* Blast Shielding: ""Reduces damage taken from explosions by 10%.""
   * Working
      * But even with the highest HP value possible, it is still impossible to survive an explosion. Tested with mods.

* Insulation: ""Grants immunity to shock.""
   * Working
      * Shock = electric damage. Electricity on ground = electric. Enemy attacks applying shock = electric. Enemy grenades = EMP (so not electric damage), meaning this will not prevent damage from grenades. I don't know what other sources of EMP there are, but this is consistent with the clothing mod as well.
* Fuck all walls: ""Reduces the charge amount needed for Tech weapons to penetrate walls by 30%.""

## Patch Notes^[Source](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37373/patch-1-1)

Patch 1.1 for Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, consoles and Stadia!

In  this update we focused on various stability improvements, which you can  find outlined in the patch notes below. We will continue this work in  patch 1.2 and other upcoming updates. At the same time we will keep  fixing the bugs you encounter and listening to your feedback on how to  improve the overall game experience.

**Stability**

Various stability improvements including:

* Memory  usage improvements in various systems within the game: characters,  interactions, navigation, in-game videos (news, tv, etc.), foliage,  laser effects, minimap, devices, AI, street traffic, environmental  damage system, GPU-related, and more.
* Various crash fixes (related to, among others, loading saves, game opening/closing and Point of No Return).

**Quests/Open World**

* Fixed an issue where calls from Delamain would end immediately and seem like they cannot be picked up in *Epistrophy*.
* Fixed an issue where players would not receive calls from Delamain when approaching relevant vehicles in *Epistrophy*.
* Fixed an issue where the objective could get stuck on ""Answer the call from Mr. Hands"" in *M'ap Tann Pèlen*.
* Fixed an issue where Judy could teleport underground in *Pyramid Song*.
* Fixed an issue where it would be impossible to talk to Zen Master in *Poem of The Atoms*.
* Fixed an issue where Takemura wouldn't call in *Down on the Street*.
* Fixed an issue where Jackie could disappear in *The Pickup*.
* Fixed an issue where it could be impossible to get out of the car in *The Beast in Me: The Big Race*.
* Fixed an issue where players could stop receiving calls and messages after moving too far away from *A Day In The Life* area.
* Fixed an issue where opening the package wouldn't update *Space Oddity*.
* Retro-fixed the saves affected by a rare issue where speaking to Judy in *Automatic Love* would be impossible due to an invisible wall. The underlying issue is under investigation.
* Fixed an issue that prevented players from collecting the reward in *Gig: Freedom of the Press*.  The quest will auto-complete for those who could not collect the reward  previously, and the reward will be provided automatically.
* Fixed an issue where Delamain would remain silent throughout *Epistrophy* if the player initially refused to help him.

﻿**UI**

* Fixed an issue where prompt for exiting braindance could be missing.
* Removed an invalid item from loot.

**Visual**

* Fixed an issue where a grenade's trajectory could be displayed in photo mode.
* Fixed particles' hue appearing pink when viewed close up.
* Fixed cars spawning incorrectly in *Reported Crime: Welcome to Night City*.

**Achievements**

* Fixed an issue where completing one of theassaults in progress in Santo Domingo would sometimes not contribute towards progression for *The Jungle* achievement, preventing its completion.

**Miscellaneous** 

* Addressed  the issue responsible for saves getting oversized (related to the  modifier indicating if the item is crafted), and trimmed the excess size  from already existing saves (note: this won’t fix PC save files  corrupted before 1.06 update). 
* Fixed an issue where input could stop registering upon opening the weapon wheel and performing an action.
* Fixed an issue where the ""Continue"" button in the Main Menu could load an end game save.

**PlayStation-specific**

* Performance optimization of crowds on PlayStation 4 Pro and PlayStation 5.
* Various crash fixes on PlayStation 4.

**Xbox-specific**

* Improved  memory usage for character creation, mirrors, scanning, camera remote  control, menus (inventory, map) on Xbox One, Xbox One X and Xbox One S.

**PC-specific**

* It  will now be possible to obtain achievements while in Steam offline  mode. Note: Offline mode needs to be enabled before starting the game.  This change does not work retroactively.
* Addressed the game startup crashes related to loading cache on NVIDIA graphics cards.

**Stadia-specific**

* Concert audio should no longer be inaudible in *Never Fade Away*.
* Fixed corrupted textures on several melee weapons.
* Tweaked  default deadzone settings to be more responsive. Note: the change will  not affect settings unless they’re set to default.";0;2524;2524;3407;0;26

34;l3xi72;Discussion;Cyberpunk 2077, for me, is the saddest episode in the gaming industry that I have ever experienced.;2021-01-24;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l3xi72/cyberpunk_2077_for_me_is_the_saddest_episode_in/;"I had seen the trailer that came back in 2013 but it didn't get me hooked. After I was done playing The Witcher 3, I came to know about CDPR. The Witcher 3 was a masterpiece, so naturally I was pretty invested in whatever that was their next project. One fine day I saw a tweet from them, it was ""Beep"", I think. And I was thrilled to know that it has begun. Saw the E3 trailer and it was okay, nothing mind blowing, honestly. But then came their gameplay trailer and I, like most of the people out there, was blown away by the sheer scale of the game. The entire premise of the game was so extraordinarily grand that I found it hard to wrap my heard around. I had never felt the same way about any other game other than Half-Life 2.

&#x200B;

Now let me come to the point,. Before I say anything else, I must tell that I have not completed the game and I have progressed through 20-25% of the main story. I am actually as disappointed with the game as I was thrilled. Bugs do not bother me. Bugs are just the wrinkles on the code sheet and they're eventually pressed out over time.

&#x200B;

The absolute failure of the game disappoints me, yes, but it's not something that saddens me. What saddens me is the little moments in the game. The sudden jolt when you're looking at tiny details of the game and realize that they are so exceptionally well done. Like have you seen how phenomenally they have animated Silverhand's hand gestures? When you open the photo mode and somehow manage to zoom in one one single subject, the details, the textures, the reflections even without RTX, the chrome plates on NPCs, markings on them. Everything is so damn gorgeous, precise and well done. And don't get me started on the guns and the cars. I have played copious amount of games and I have not seen any game that has a better gun design, as well as the car design; I know that's a subjective affair but still. The car designs are so well done. Unique and original. I have this car called, Jefferson or something like that, and its front is a pure expression of how unique their designs are. It is highly asymmetrical and still very beautiful. The characters, although I have not met many, are so well crafted that you can literally take a closeup of any part of their bodies {except some(of course)} and make a wallpaper out of it. Have you seen the neck of Takemura? Those gorgeous red undertones with Arasaka stamped on it. The design itself has a certain depth to it which makes you wonder about how things ended up where they are. Other than the design, the campaign missions are so well executed and acted. I am leaving out on writing about this part because it brings out the spoilery stuff. But it is very well done. Amazing, really.

&#x200B;

When you're reveling in these tiny gorgeous little details, it strikes you, the idea that this game could've been one of the greatest video games ever made, but sadly in its entirety it does not even come close. Spread out the game and you will find exceptionally well done parts right along with parts that exist just as placeholders. And this vast distance between what this game is and what it could have been makes it the saddest episode of the gaming industry for me. 

&#x200B;

I have no idea about the future of Cyberpunk 2077, all I know is that CDPR lost all the trust they had gathered over the years and also missed out on the opportunity that could've taken them to the apex.";0;2227;2227;476;0;9

17;l4chwa;Discussion;In my 28 years of Gaming Experiences... Cyberpunk 2077 is by far the most unbalanced gaming experience I've had to date.;2021-01-24;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l4chwa/in_my_28_years_of_gaming_experiences_cyberpunk/;"Hi all, I feel like it's time to share my opinions and thoughts after letting this subreddit cooldown for sometime. Around February of last year, I began work on a massive passion project developing [https://NETRUNNER2077.net](https://NETRUNNER2077.net) after following this title and being a massive fan of CD Projekt Red from the original Witcher title. When they announced Cyberpunk 2077 would be their next IP I was immensely excited as I'm a huge Cyberpunk genre nerd in all forms from art, movies, anime, philosophies, books, cultural significance and relation, aesthetics and more. So having my all time favorite game company work on a huge open world Cyberpunk ""RPG"" instantly generated immediate interest.

**Now where to even begin?**

Please note, I've yet to purposely ""finish"" Cyberpunk 2077 in hopes of CD Projekt Red making a strong come back later on in the future, and hopes that they'll eventually release a REDKit for modders in order to create some incredible work and help flesh the game world out. I have put around close to 200 hours into Cyberpunk 2077 exploring the different Life Paths and their effects on the world. Lots of walking, No fast travel and tons of time lost in an attempt to ""Immerse"" myself in the experience. I refused to finish Cyberpunk 2077's Main Story for several reasons. The largest being I'm typically against playing titles that are obviously not complete. On top of that, I've invested so much time and effort into researching, designing, learning web design and working towards building an awesome platform in order to properly cover Cyberpunk 2077 with a safe bet of thinking ""This couldn't possibly be bad"" only to coming around to reality very shortly after and that this title truly needed ATLEAST another year of development time.

There are aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 that are, in my opinion, worthy of putting it in the all time legendary category of games. Then.. other parts that make games from even 20 years ago look superior. It's a very ""unbalanced"" experience. So much that it takes the top spot for me personally. My experience of Cyberpunk 2077 is that it feels unfinished and some what rushed in many areas, if that isn't obvious enough already. But the thing is, as many of you probably already know, it just isn't bugs. Features, Content, Weapons, Immersive Elements, AI, RPG Elements and Game Design Systems are flat out missing or just straight up broken entirely.

Here are just a few of the elements that I have a problem with personally..

* **Weapon Balance** \- Many weapons are straight up overpowered and unbalanced and easy to find early in the game.
* **Weapon Variety** \- CD Projekt Red claimed that the game would have a large variety of weapons - this ended up not being the case with a few showcased weapons not implemented in the game itself although they exist in the game files. Also to note most ""Iconic"" weapons are just a reskin.
* **Cyberware Balance & Variety -** Same thing as above can also account for Cyberware. Outside of Cyber Arm implants, which has its own bulletin
* **Very Hard Difficulty** \- Feels like a joke when compared to a lot titles out there. This is coming from someone who chose Style over Substance in all three playthroughs, typically never using a Jacket, Helmet or Mask. I'm no means great at games. This doesn't help with the extremely bugged out AI.
* **Perk Balance and Design** \- All around, most perks feel unrewarding and feel vastly unbalanced, once again making it pretty easy to feel overpowered pretty quickly early on, especially if you end up going down the Quickhacking Sub Skill Tree.
* **Pedestrian, Water and Car Damage Physics / Collision needs a serious second look** \- Water as of Patch 1.1 is still a pretty much nothing more than a transparent texture.. fire a bullet, a person, hell.. a fucking car and there is not a single pinch of reaction from that what so ever. The collision from bullets, other cars, people and objects is just bad for a 2020 game.
* **UI** \- I'm usually not one to complain about an unintuitive UI but it's quite clunky that takes some time to get around and use to.
* **Artificial Intelligence** \-  It's either extremely bugged or just barely there. It's very bare bones in EVERY NON SCRIPTED aspect of the game. This has already been covered a thousand times so there's no need to go deep into detail with this. Vehicles, Police, Pedestrians, Etc.
* **Lack of Immersive Elements** \- One of CD Projekt Red biggest selling points for many fans was making it sound like there would be many ways to Immerse yourself in Cyberpunk 2077. That is not the case outside of World Design, World Building and Story Telling. It's really hard to actually ""Immersive yourself and Roleplay"" You can't sit at a bar and grab a drink in real time. You can't grab food anytime you like and eat in real time, the few vendors there are in the game completely rip you out of the game world and into a standard UI vendor menu. Installing Cyberware is just a click of a button in a menu after the initially Eye and hand implant, There's bare minimum interactivity with NPC's or the world itself for that matter, Not a single soul uses an umbrella that I've witnessed when it rains in Night City, There's little to no sense in danger outside of the repetitive Gang hotspots... the list could go on and on with this one.
* **90% of the choices you make during Cyberpunk 2077 feel like they have little to no consequence** \- While it's true that there are SOME choices you make in this game change certain outcomes (For the most part - the end of the game as reported by many) It feels like a very bare bones system that doesn't seem fleshed out at all. The majority of the time you're only given the ""Illusion of Choice"" This was very disappointing to witness. Life path decisions feel utterly meaningless later on down the road.
* **Side Quests are typically very short when compared to Witcher 3** \- On top of that, there are a handful of stunning Side quests but it was very disappointing when a large majority of them lasted around 5-10 minutes at most. If you're looking for another Baron equivalent quest line.. It ain't here chief.
* **The Main Quest is far too short for a game that attempts to coin itself as being ""RPG""** \- Regardless of not finishing, its pretty obvious that you do a small handful of Main Story Quests (Outside of the Optional ones) and you've reached the end.
* **Life Paths do not largely impact your overall experience and the way the game and story unfolds** \- Outside of the VERY beginning of the game, which can roughly take around 10 to 20 minutes to do.. and maybe a single quest depending on your lifepath, They ended up being extremely disappointing. You really aren't missing out on doing multiple life paths as you can basically ""choose"" your ending at the epilogue of the game and just restart from a save and make a different decision to see different outs. AKA making all the decisions you made throughout the game feel meaningless because in the end, its only what you choose during the epilogue that really matters.
* **A Second Note on Life Paths and Dialogue Impacting Secondary and Third Playthroughs** \-  Very few side main quests can make a small difference by the end and there is no tension build up for your dialogue options that will lead to consequences that make you afraid of your choices later down the story.
* **What the hell happened to Meredith Stout? -** If you went down the route of siding with Meredith Stout during the Maelstrom Mission and have followed Cyberpunk 2077 for some time you were probably completely thrown off as to how cut off that whole ""follow up"" went down. Very disappointing.
* **Dynamic Vehicle Chases / Fights are not a thing and were removed from the game** \- The one Scav chase in the beginning of the game is scripted.. and that's about it, hell.. you can just sit in the vehicle and watch it crash into the wall without doing a single thing. What the hell? Sorry guys, If you choose to mess with gangs.. they're not going to hunt you down, they aren't going to mow you down while you're in your vehicle. It was all bullshit.
* **Gangs / Corps will ignore the actions you take against their gang / corp and there are no repercussions for your actions against them at any point in the game** \- This goes with the one above, but I figured I'd expand on it more. Remember when we thought siding with Maelstrom would cause dire consequences in the long run with Meredith and Militech? Guess what? it definitely isn't a thing. You can go about your business in Night City and not have to worry about that for a split second your entire playthrough, no matter who you decide to fuck over.
* **Side Gigs are typically just filler content -** Very little variety and the only way to really extend your playtime if you choose to not walk the streets of a dead feeling night city attempting to immerse yourself in the world. Which is totally okay if there were also other things to do, but for the most part its just generic Ubisoft tier filler content. There are a very SMALL amount of unique ones with actual dialogue.
* **Netrunner Enemy Types** \- The worst they do is upload a low quality damage hack and that's it. Half the time they scan your location and nothing happens.  No cool shit like having to tap a button repeatedly to stop you from pulling the trigger on yourself after being hacked.
* **Pacifica is obviously unfinished -** Well, it's not hard to tell that Pacifica wasn't complete after the game came out, I fully know the lore behind what happened to Pacifica, but I don't see how it's acceptable that there are literally unfinished areas from game development.
* **MAX-TAC and Trauma Team were epic during the early Scav Hideout mission, but that's it** \- Not much else to say here other than they had some really cool ""scripted"" events during and after that mission.. but other than that you'll see Trauma Team with their ships in the same exact spots you find them and MAX-TAC basically just spawn in as higher tier cops when your wanted level is high enough.
* **Cyberpsycho Quest line was a missed opportunity** \- Quite a disappointing quest after tracking down 17 Cyberpsychos regardless if you choose to let them live or kill them. They could of gone deep into some gritty cyberpunk writing and mystery with this but their approach to this was pretty underwhelming and surface level with no depth other than some logs you find, but this can be said about MANY of the quests during the game.
* **Collecting Cars is just more checkmark optional filler -** Hey? Want another vehicle? Let me flood your quest list and phone letting you know you can GPS right to the location and pick it up. Outside of the few hidden vehicles in the game, Collecting cars was pretty disappointing. You literally walk up to location and buy them, no interactivity with NPC's, just click and buy. Might as well of just given a option to have the vehicle self deliver to the non existent garage where all my other cars reside right?
* **The Garage outside your Megabuilding serves no purpose and doesn't store your vehicles** \- Can't find your vehicles there now can you? Yeah..
* **The 6 Month Montage felt like a giant slap in the face, quite possibly cut missions from early game and is the exact SAME no matter what life path you choose** \- Going down any life path will grant you the exact same Street Kid themed montage. It really feels like these were cut missions that would of fleshed Jackie Welles as a character out so much better.
* **Cyberpunk 2077 feels more like a decent ""Action Adventure"" Game rather than a true ""RPG""** \- Not too hard to see this. While it has RPG elements and Dialogue, it's definitely not on the level of Dues Ex, Vampire Bloodlines, Divinity, Elder Scrolls, Fallout (3 & NV). After you exit the prologue it is all downhill after that.
* **There isn't much to find and see outside of map markers** \- While there are a handful of secrets, schematics and weapons it doesn't feel very rewarding when finding these things because of how the weapon, items, currency and game design elements were implemented where things are either easily replaced or you're already easily overpowered as it is.
* **Cyberpunk tries to be too many things and falls short of most of them** \- With the Ambitious goals, talk and promises.. The one thing I hoped it would be was a truly Ambitious RPG with some really good Immersive elements. I definitely wasn't expecting the world, but it's just sad as to how many elements it falls flat on.
* **Black Market Cyberware isn't a thing** \- You see those four options you have for Cyber arms? Yep, That's it. Nothing else, Everything shown through trailers is what you get.
* **Brain Dance was a MASSIVE missed opportunity -** It's pretty obvious that there was at one time far more to brain dance outside of story missions. Hell, it could of found a way to replace the Gwent Mini Game, but alas - In the end it was used for only story missions and not a single side experience on its own.
* **Night City just feels like a extremely gorgeous backdrop to a Somewhat Linear story** \- I've already covered several reasons as to why I feel this way.
* **It feels more like ""Johnny's Story"" rather than V's Story** \- While the writing is indeed excellent most of the time. I personally feel like this story is more about Johnny rather than V.
* **The sense of urgency after the prologue really makes it hard to ""Role Play"" V correctly. This conflicts with previous statements made by CDPR ""Really wanting players to Role Play the character""**\- The way this was approached was quite confusing, as CDPR offers this massive world yet having a huge urgency that you need to figure out a solution before you die in a few weeks.
* **The World does not feel ""Alive"" by any means.. Lack of Dynamic Events** \- The world itself just feels pretty dead outside of flying vehicles and ads going off every 4-5 seconds. There is VERY little dynamic content like you see in RDR2 where they put a huge emphasis on the world feeling ""alive"" and never knowing what could happen.
* **Customization is severely lacking from a world that begs for more of it** \- Luckily if you're on PC, a lot of these issues have been solved with customizable Cyber arms, More tattoos, Hair Styles, Face and Neck Cyberware and more. If you're on Console though, you're sadly shit out of luck. The lack of visible Cyberware for V was very surprising. No visible Cyber legs, No visible Netrunning gear outside of ""Suits"", etc.
* **Jackie Welles was a brilliant character that was quickly thrown away** \- Let alone the massive spoiler they decided to showcase via the 2019 E3 CG Trailer, It was extremely disheartening to know that saving Jackie was never an option seeing as we were barely given any time with him and a wasted opportunity for possible great plot points. This could of been remedied by actually going through the missions played out in the 6 month montage. For players unfamiliar following Cyberpunk 2077 for so long, I would assume losing Jackie wasn't near as impactful for them.
* **Cyberware Arm implants are just alternative weapons for the most part** \- Which pretty much become useless unless you choose to use Gorilla Fists the whole game. No Utility from them, No useful tool elements, Just weapons that become obsolete very fast.
* **For a Dystopian World that is hyper sexualized, there sure is a lack of sexual content** \- Not hard to miss this, You have two Joy Toys and two high end JT's later in the game to choose from in the entirety of Night City outside of the selection of Story related characters you come across.  Hell, even a lot of characters that dance on poles in the world are fully clothed. Let alone any real Adult themed clubs.
* **Trains were a missed opportunity** \- Let's face it, there were obviously systems in place at one point in development to have an actual train system where you could ride around Night City and be able to enjoy the huge vistas that it offers. Now you can just watch one from a distance disappear right through a building.
* **Verticality? Sort of..?** \- Take your Home Megabuilding for example and also prime example of cut areas and content. There were suppose to be several areas of verticality to explore in the world and areas and this is just not the case anymore.
* **""You'll never run into cool areas where you'll want to get in there but can't"" -** Yeah, that was definitely not the case now was it? There are several areas you would think would be accessible but just aren't or at any point in the game are.
* **Acid Rain?** Yeah.. No. - Remember this? Yeah I haven't witnessed it either. But hey, at least there's acid fog right?

Then you have this huge dystopic metropolis of a city which looks absolutely phenomenal. I think it'll truly go down in history for its amazing design and the techniques they used to craft this insanely dense city. There's truly nothing like visiting Night City and it surely is a unique experience from a VISUAL and AUDIO design standpoint. The writing is solid most of the time as well. It really just feels like they had a very direct deadline and were forced to wrap systems up after changing the core game several times over and over again which caused loads of bugs in the code. I really hope when I come back to this game in a year it'll be quite different but after what CDPR pulled I find it extremely hard to trust and have faith in them.

I had so much faith and love in this company that I ended up spending countless months building, designing, and launching NETRUNNER 2077 almost single handedly but after playing Cyberpunk 2077 for weeks, I couldn't even bring myself to write a review over it. Honestly, I would've been way too critical and harsh. Especially after having to monitor and dissect everything that was ""said"" to be in the game and how systems were suppose to ""work"" and it ended up being nothing like that what so ever. At this point and time I have no motivation or confidence to continue the platform due to the recent events and actions of CDPR's upper management as well as the highly manipulative marketing that made Cyberpunk 2077 only a glass half full of what it was intended to actually be.

I made sure to set my expectations accordingly from what was told from developers to fans via interviews, deep dives and what was reported to sources that was approved by CDPR. With that and the EXTREMELY misleading marketing, it leaves an extremely sour taste in my mouth. I really want to have faith that they can turn this title around, but something feels off. I understand from a legal perspective that they probably cant at the moment. I just hope one day that this game can truly live up to its potential. There is an incredible foundation set, but it's ultimately up to CD Projekt Red if they choose to deliver their originally intended vision.

For other upper management in game development out there possibly reading this-  if your game isn't finished, please market it correctly as an ""Early Access Game"" and not a finished product. That is straight up lying and deceiving fans and consumers out there. It isn't right, and needs to stop.";0;3396;3396;716;0;52

 Why is it my favorite game? I don't know, I like Sci-Fi, cyberpunk is a new genre to me that I am developing a love of, I absolutely love customizability, the characters invest me- I'm not an emotional person but I've cried multiple times playing this game, the story is intriguing, and it's just fun. 

 I was never aboard the hype train, I only really discovered it a little before last Christmas and asked for it on a whim, so maybe the gargantuan expectations the game generated is an even bigger puzzle piece on why the game is so unilaterally hated than you might think.

924;l4ogdw;Self;[Opinion] Cyberpunk 2077 is probably a software architecture nightmare;2021-01-25;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l4ogdw/opinion_cyberpunk_2077_is_probably_a_software/;"TL:DR: I highly suspect that this game represents an ambitious and progressive software architect's idealist world getting shattered by the reality of eventual consistency.

I am just speculating so take it with a grain of salt. Nothing is verified, it is just my opinion.

I pre-ordered the game almost 1.5 years ago. After patch 1.1 I decided to give it a go. My PC specs are not best of the best thanks to AMD/Nvidia shortages. 8700k + 1070 TI.

I am a 10+ years experienced web backend developer and the game reminded me of our daily struggles with [Event-Driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture), [Eventual Consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) and [Asynchronous Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)). This reminds me the company I'm working for right now. These concepts implemented poorly and we are having similar problems.

Even with on a PC with SSD, I saw textures popping up later. I'm not even using high res textures. I saw some videos from old generation consoles. Holly sh\*t it's bad. I read that the texture files are generally bundled in modern big titles so it can be loaded with a single request faster. This results in duplicated textures hence huge game files. Cyberpunk is not a huge game but this could result in data streaming problems.

Event-Driven Architecture, Eventual Consistency and Asynchronous Processing all leads to the same thing. High scalability, low consistency. It is pretty good for multiple teams working on the same project, can speed up development process but when implemented poorly it creates huge overhead and inconsistency. This is what I experienced in the game.

There are events happening and systems responding to it async. The annoying thing, the game is a single state machine. If they also rely on eventual consistency too much it f\*cked them. Imagine receiving 2 different events in a very short time frame. 1st event takes longer to process. 2nd one is a quick one. While 1st one is being processed 2nd one can be finished and change the state something into 1st one is invalid. Look at this [police chase](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/l3y47g/after_over_80_hours_of_gameplay_i_have_finally/). The game state is definitely overwritten by some kind of an event, suddenly police got disappeared. Oh I love eventual consistency.

\- If you kill a civilian, crime event happens and police should come. If the software piece that should trigger police spawn doesn't know where you are and just orders spawn police, they suddenly spawn [on a rooftop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVJtS8sJ408). This happens especially if you seperate the system in multiple domains and be lazy to read necessary data from another domain. 

To be honest, I am not expecting this game to be perfect any time soon. It will probably never be as ""open world"" like GTA. Game is cool though. Just expectation management was pretty bad.

&#x200B;

Look, I get it. You're in damage control mode. You have to protect your reputation. That's understandable. But you might want to give yourself a break here. Rushing the fixes makes it even worse. This whole situation occured because **you made unsustainable promises on unrealistic deadlines**. 

You **promised** a game of the same quality than a RDR2 or a GTA, featuring a vast, living, breathing world of unprecedented vertical scale, immersion and involvment. During the developpement, you showed some amazing gameplay with lots of features that looked incredible (I won't go over the whole list of **promised** features that you failed to deliver, some people already did a great job with that), and the fall back to reality was rough. For you, and for us.

Over the course of developpement, you stumbled across various challenges, I can sympathize. Then you delayed the game (for ovious reasons as we now know) multiple times, each of which you **promised** that the only reason you did it was that you could deliver a flawless piece of art.

Carried by the endless ""Witcher 3 quality"" **promises** and never-ending partnerships and features annoucements, the hype was strong, and even grew in epic proportions. The few media outlets allowed to test the game went full Boyle with a landslide of awards and perfect scores for a game they didn't even test appropriately on console (I remember the ""Best Playstation game"" award, deliciously appropriate now that it's removed from the PS store).

When the game finally came out in stores, the optimisation was a disaster on consoles, to say the least. We all remember the statement ""It runs surprisingly well on console"", and after the release, ""surprisingly"" sounded like one hell of an understatement. Then again, in a tweet, you **promised** to restore your reputation a few days after the backlash.

By the time reality sinked in, more and more people started to realize that there were not only bugs in there, there was a shit ton of scrapped features, some of which still have their weird skeletons in the final product. You even based some of your advertisement strategy on those **promised** features. And still, those who made it to the final game were mere ghosts of what you said they would be.

And then, fast forward a few weeks, even when you ""apologized"" for a few, *carefully picked* issues, you **promised** to ""fix"" the game in only a few months with ""massives"" patches. Welp, tough luck. The 1.1 messiah is dead in the gutter. Probably along with your crunched devs, which you also **promised** not to crunch again, while maintaining, even now,unrealistic deadlines.

&#x200B;

I think you get the point. Stop the promises, stop the unrealistic deadlines. Thoses are the reasons you couldn't stay true to your original vision. 

It has come to the point that you're now hurting yourself in this race for a good, rushed, early access game. It's like looking at someone trying to wash a stain with a stained towel with some really poor hand coordination. This is becoming sad.

Lay low, take the time to properly work on a viable plan to save your game, and you might save your reputation along the way.

&#x200B;

I really hope I can come back to this game in a year or two, and have, maybe, some good chunks of the awesome game you dreamt to make back in 2013.";0;1764;1764;595;0;14

Who was behind the brainwashing devices and gadgetry that monitored the Peralez family? Was his wife in on it, or was she just a victim too? Were corpos who were wary of his anti-corpo platform trying to control him? Did Peralez have the same populist beliefs prior to his brain-manipulation or were those implanted too? Is something/someone even bigger controlling Night City politics?

I finally meet Brigitte after they’re surprised I’m still alive and all she has to say about Evelyn is she’s a whore?! They’re lucky Judy isn’t there to blow up the place.

It's a one shot head shot for most enemies, even body shot sometimes. It's upgradable to Legendary and it shoots through walls.
I added a non lethal mod to it as soon as I could and I just went around blowing people's heads off ""non lethally"".

Oh and you get it from the Panam quest line, so it means something.

Seriously, every mission this whole game I've just used Ping to spot everyone, and then one shot them through every wall in the building. I have a sword for backup, but that's basically it.

I've tried a few other guns here and there and none of them can compare. I mean sure, smart tracking is nice and all, but does it one shot through walls? Yeah didn't think so.

Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.";0;18;18;23;0;0

If youre on a high end pc it looks great no doubt. There are a handful of great characters too but theyre pretty much one and done. you can end their story lines in a session easily then theyre pretty much gone. They hyped up the racing and fighting...the fighting is super lame and there are 3 races that are super easy and ""on rails"" . For the amount of unique cars in the game there's no point besides looking cool. After that there's nothing to do in the world besides copy paste two minute gang fights. The story is ultra short for a ""RPG"" . They even touted that as some kind of selling point : ""We cut out lots of story because people didnt finish the witcher 3"" .  They did a great job hyping the game and showing off stuff you can barely do in game but 5 year old games like deus ex and others did the same stuff much better. I know its been said a million times already but I felt the need to say it myself,lol. I dont care about bugs and shit either, just in general...the game isnt very deep and is much too short for what it is. They built a big beautiful boring world. I can see the potential for sure but it has a long way to go unfortunately.  They should have hired some better people instead of spending all that advertising money. It worked for them either way, they made off like bandits...I bought it too. Probably the most disappointing game in recent memory though versus the hype it created. No one cares but I had to say it, cheers.";0;29;29;39;0;0

85;lbpqdt;Discussion;I got a feeling the Militech cut content rabbit hole goes way deeper than we think. (Spoiler for main storyline as well as Cyberpunk 2020);2021-02-03;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/lbpqdt/i_got_a_feeling_the_militech_cut_content_rabbit/;"I'm basing this theory on three things, in game dialogue, cut content and established Cyberpunk lore. In other words I'm not talking out my ass and this is why I think Militech was originally a key player in the story. 

Facts:

\-There is a detailed Militech building in corpo plaza blocked off by both visible and invisible walls and   
  broken elevators.

\- Stout basically ghost's you after explicitly mentioning further work for V in the future which as we know never happens.

\- Militech is known to hire solos for black ops they can't be seen doing (i.e. Morgan Blackhand, Shaitan, Cyberpunk 2020 player characters, etc. ) as well as funding and organizing acts of terrorism against Arasaka (i.e. the 2023 attack on Arasaka tower was a Militech operation) 

\-After Blackhand went MIA and members of strike teams Alpha, Beta and Omega either retired, went underground or died, Militech has been probably looking for solos to replace Blackhand.

\-Militech knows about Mikoshi and Alt Cunningham as it's destruction and the rescue of Cunningham where secondary objectives during the incursion into Arasaka Tower. 

Theory:

I believe there was supposed to be a Militech storyline which would've offered great character development for V, Johnny and Stout and even a Militech ending culminating in the start of the 5th corpo war and V becoming the new Blackhand. It could've gone something like this:

After Life During Wartime and before act 3  with a certain amount of street cred Stout calls you to offer you a gig that appears to be as simple as any generic fixer contract, unbeknown to V, Stouts supervisors are actually probing V  trying to determine V's worth as an asset. Mission turns out to be more complicated and V manages to impress the Militech officials. Then V would be further contacted to do a number of increasingly interesting black ops for them, similar to the Aldecaldo story arch. V then negotiates for help with the relic and and reaches an agreement with the Mili equivalent of Hellman to help them out in exange to becoming the companies' lead solo (like Blackhand back in the 20's). This could've lead to a Militech ending where it turns out they have been scrambling to find a way to take avantage of the internal strugles in Saka after Saburo's murder. 

It also would've offered interesting character development.

Johnny:  This could've been a deep dive into Johnny's hypocrisy, as V would learn the truth about the 2023 attack and that the anti-corpo rockerboy everyone knows is actually a corpo funded black ops agent and that he has no right to judge you. JS would go on about means and ends blah blah blah and ultimately but reluctantly understand V and agree that taking down Arasaka is worth compromising just as he did 50 years back. 

Stout: The player would have a choice to keep things professional with Stout (in order to pursue another lover) or could also pursue Stout romantically, V's gender wouldn't be an issue since Stout is known to be bisexual.  Either way you wold see her character be better developed past the current angry horny corpo-rat. 

&#x200B;

Plausible Ending:

Nocturne Op happens, you say goodbye to your lover of choice, you take the blue pill(not based) and follow in Johnny's 2023 footsteps, he says some bullshit like here we go again and disappears until Mikoshi, you call Stout since you know the Militech takeover is happening soon enough, convince the executives to start the assault ahead of schedule, Miltech equivalent of Hellman agrees to help V with the chip. V, unmarked Militech elites and a colorful bunch of solos launch a coordinated attack on Saka tower while the bigger Militech is launching their nationwide hostile takeover. Awesome firefight, Alt connects to the building, V fights Smasher, Changes happens, six months bullshit, AI's go free, ""Goodbye V never stop fighting"" Militech actually destroys Mikoshi this time around, V becomes the new Blackhand and works for Militech now, any lover except Meredith leaves you, Militech sees V valuable enough to research treatment for them, 5th corpo war happens, V goes down in history alongside Blackhand and Silverhand as the destroyers of Arasaka, credits roll, voicemails and Never Fade Away. 

&#x200B;

And that's what I think the Militech story arc would've looked like. It's lore friendly, fits with the characters and based on past events. The cut Militech building and Stout's disappearance are enough to convince me something  similar to this was planed. The fact Johnny's memories purposely glossed over the fact Militech coordinated his attack lead me to believe he was being an unreliable narrator and his Militech connection would be a big reveal later on.

Anyway let me know what  you think and apologies for grammar but English is my second language.";0;803;803;150;0;5

It's like Terminator, Mad Max, Fallout, Borderlands, Blade runner, Underworld, Deus Ex, Hotline Miami, Matrix, all the shit I love rolled into one. I had no idea it existed, downloaded it on a whim and have deliberately kept from reading anything about it online because I hear it's getting a lot of flak. So far I've loved every second of it.

Got to where Watson goes out of lockdown before I rerolled a new character with better looks and more sensible perks. Currently I'm running a Nomad girl with Body and Crafting, and it's so fun to be this cheerleader blonde who switches on her Berserk mod and goes Arnold in every mission before returning home to craft more STUFF. Can't wait to see how the mantis blades feel, but that's for the Streetkid playthrough.

And yeah I can sort of get why people are mad. The framerate is choppy and I've glitched through a wall once. I can scrap soda cans for more than they're worth and make millions before even going out of the tutorial. Guns have several mod slots but will only accept one mod. It's rushed and rough around the edges, but the things it does good it does SO good that there's no comparison. Reminds me of the STALKER games in some way, but unlike those I'm pretty sure the devs will do a decent job patching it.

I experience a little sadness about Cyberpunk 2077's bad release. I think that it was mostly anticipated game of the last year, maybe even the last decade. It was a failure if we're looking on a context of all the events surrounding this game. Huge marketing campaign which showed us not the game itself, but how beautiful it could be.

However, my post is something bigger than simple retrospective. You see, this game is getting it's patches and hotfixes. It sounds funny when you realize that this game needs a big update rather than small hotfixes. I look on Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and Baldur's Gate III. These games get their patches and hotfixes almost every week and every day. All we do is looking on patch notes and see how progress goes on. They are not very playable at the moment. But there is one big difference. **These games are labeled to be in early access.** This is not just a symbolic label: **when it's gone, we will understand that now we can play a complete game**.

Cybeprunk 2077 is not playable now. I mean, it is, it can be played through the end, but most of the players report bugs, bad optimization. Also, we remember that there were so much good content that was cut: using mantis blades to climb on walls, using subway system (one of the trailers begins with it), wardrobe, third person in cutscenes. **By all means Cyberpunk 2077 game is in early access.**

I'm okay with this. Many people are okay with this. **You needed more time and we understand it - so take it, please, we really don't mind.** I'd even like you to take your game out of the stores to re-release it somewhere in 2022, but it may be problematic on the other hand. But anyway, **we need a SIGN that your game is ready and playable**. We need a sign that you've made everything you wanted to do. No matter if it's going to be 2021, 2022 or even 2023. We just want to know it when your game is okay. Not like it was with Batman: Arkham Knight or Assassin's Creed Unity, when you need to find it out somewhere in forums if the game was already fixed and then play it. **No, we need a understandable sign from CD Projekt Red.**

**And this is why I call you to give Cyberpunk 2077 an ""early access"" label on Steam and other platforms.** It's not just a symbolic thing, as I told before. When you're get out of early access, people are going to RUSH into your game again because this is going to be Cyberpunk 2077 they've waited for ten years. It's going to be a great event we all deserve and a very happy day for every developer who was making Cyberpunk 2077.

This is all I wanted to say. No hate, as you can see. Thank you for your time, good luck.";0;545;545;271;0;7

418;lejsqs;Question;Enemies taking too many bullets?;2021-02-07;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/lejsqs/enemies_taking_too_many_bullets/;"Hello everyone!

Purchased CP2077 last weekend and played it now for about 10,5 hours (being in act 2). I really like the story, the visuals and level design but there is one thing that really bugs me a lot...enemies seem to be very strong (no matter what risk level). Taking so many bullets. 

eg:  
In the Flathead mission where you kull Rogue (or so) and then fight your way to exit. I could load 2 mags with my assault rifle into an enemy and he still does not get down, same with shotguns. This made me jump & run to the exit.

Now I play the Delamain taxi mission. Where I catched the first one, there was a Valentinos gang next to it. I had no change to even kill a single one but they nearly one shot me. Grenades (explosive or shock) don´t even look like doing damage. The taxi I have to catch lead me into an ambush where I have to kill all gang members. With some luck I was able to kill one but the others killed me from distance with 1 or 2 bullets. No idea how to pass this one.

I don´t even try to do side missions where I have to fight.  
Is there any secret to it?   


At the moment I use eg a Tamayanas (?) pistol with 114 SPS and a M2038 shotgun with 112 SPS and my real SPS is 124 with amor 108. Playing on normal difficulty on PC.

  
MANY THANKS in advance!

Did the Dirty Biz mission.;2021-02-11;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/lhg211/finally_got_the_game_did_the_dirty_biz_mission/;"The whole time the dad was trying to justify himself I had the gun pointed at his son. I was waiting for a trigger of dialogue or something. After the dad got quiet I couldn’t take it anymore I was so pissed off. This father is a willful cog in the wheel that lead to a child being killed for a snuff film... and I am sure plenty others too. I am a father of two beautiful children, and I did what ever father should and would do... I shot the guys son in the head leaving a big hole where his brains used to be. A single shot and nothing more. I wanted the dad to know, to know how it feels to have his child killed.

And then he started to cry and beg and let me tell you the voice actor deserves an award for his acting here, man he sells that pain. I know the pain of losing a loved one and my reaction was the same as his. 

And while he was there on his knees crying that scene from House of 1000 Corpses popped into my head, the one where Otis executes the cop after a very long and painful pause. I did the same. I pointed my gun and let him live with his guilt for about a minute, then then I pulled the trigger. I didn’t even loot the room afterwards. I just walked out to finish the mission.


2 days later I am still thinking about it. This is probably the best mission in the game for making the feels happen. I have been cold blood killin’ everyone that crosses me in this game, but this was completely different. I was put into a moral dilemma of should I kill these two people or just leave, or should I kill the dad and I let the child live, or should I kill a child and let the dead suffer knowing that he’s a part of this pain? This dilemma I feel is the closest to a true cyberpunk story like Judge Dredd and the first deep philosophical situation this game gets into. Everything else up to this point was scripted action for action line for line. This was my first choice of the game, and damn is it a hell of a choice.

I can’t be the only one that this particular mission messed with.";0;26;26;17;0;0

Video during calls gave you an idea on what that person was doing. Now they just stand there in a dark room. 

Environmental take-downs removed. 

“Reflex Booster” now an implant instead of chem. 

Truly destructible environment removed. 

You now start with basic eye implant, “demo” says you don't have one at first. 

Can not bring people back to your apartment. 

Silverhand is mentioned as “been a year since he went on his last ride”, meaning that he hasn't been gone that long and him having implants makes sense. I highly doubt we will have cybernetics that advanced in two years. 

Apartment no longer has window interface to check messages and control interior environment. 

Stats for clothes have been completely redone to be just a basic armor stat instead of having resistances to various damage and street cred. 

Street cred was supposed to be used to unlock new vendors. Now all are unlocked, only some items are locked by street cred which doesn't make much sense. Vendors would only care if you have the money. 

As far a I have seen, nobody actually uses those motorized scooters you see all over the place. 

NPCs actually used elevators by themselves and interacted with the world instead of just walk down the street. 

Personalized ads removed. 

Elevators could go to multiple floors, not just “your's” and “lobby”. 

NPC count is WAY down. 

Usable trains removed. 

So much wrong with the whole road system and NPC vehicle AI. 

Info from shards looked so much better. 

Crime scenes, need I say more? 

Buying from Ripperdoc's looked like you sat in the chair, picked from an actual computer screen instead of a menu screen, and you could see them working on it. So much wasted potential. 

The idea of “illegal” cyberware is no longer available. 

Vehicle customization removed. 

“Other types of vehicles” as in not cars or bikes, removed. 

“Your actions directly influence your open-world experience” removed. It doesn't matter what you do, nothing in the city or your interactions changes. 

Can no longer take Jackie with you on missions. 

Dialog looks like you had lots of options, now it is very linear. 

The Inspection System, man I wanted to play around with that. 

Controlling the Flathead for more than that one part. 

“Street modded” weapons. 

Highlighting enemies that will be hit with your weapon via ricochet or wall penetration removed. Now requires Ping. 

Weapon modules removed. 

Connecting to enemy neural system removed. 

Connecting to networks to get information or to control something removed. 

Wallrunning removed. 

Climbing via Mantis Blades removed. 

Weapon classes like “Corpo” removed. 

Cannot lift cars to use as shields. 

Cannot use objects in environment to become cover. (e.g. shoot car lift to drop car.) 

  
That is just what I was able to find from a basic glance. Let me know if you saw anything I missed.";0;188;188;141;0;2

41;lieajr;Discussion;Do yall legitimately dislike this game?;2021-02-12;https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/lieajr/do_yall_legitimately_dislike_this_game/;"On the level: I am enjoying this game. Of course the bugs are annoying- I even had to restart because the main quest progression bugged out on me. 

The game itself has been greatly entertaining. They were clearly trying to innovate with some of the combat- I mean, you can basically be anything from a muscle Head who beats people to death with a crowbar to a techno-wizard setting five people on fire through a camera 600m away. The story itself is entertaining; the gigs are all unique. Even the assaults in progress and reported crimes have backstory you can figure out to add more depth to tbe game world. 

So, do yall actually hate the game, or do you hate the bugs? What I mean is, if they got all the kinks ironed out, would the prevailing opinion change? Personally, this game feels as immersive as some of the best I've played.";0;134;134;417;0;0

You’re scared to fall under his charm because you don’t know what could happen.

Since there is so much hatred towards the devs and the company I just thought I share my two cents. I have seen only a handful of bugs in 1.0 and I don’t think the devs deserve all this rubbish that you put on them.

Dear devs Continue making awesome games. The majority of people love this game as seen in the steam review data

They still don't acknowledge how hugely they have fucked up, cops AI, AI in general, cut content, lackluster side activities, no depth at all, etc. - this is why I don't care anymore about CDPR.;0;230;230;183;0;4
